\s5
\c 1
\p
\v 1 The former book I wrote, Theophilus, told all that Jesus began to do and to teach,
\v 2 until the day that he was received up. This was after he had given a command through the Holy Spirit to his chosen apostles,
\v 3 the ones to whom he appeared alive after his suffering. For forty days he kept appearing to them, saying things about the kingdom of God.

\s5
\v 4 When he was meeting together with them he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for the promise of the Father, about which, he said, "You heard from me
\v 5 that John indeed baptized with water but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit in a few days ."
\p

\s5
\v 6 When they were assembled together they asked him, "Lord, is this the time you will restore the kingdom to Israel?"
\v 7 He said to them, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father has determined by his own authority.
\v 8 But you will receive power, when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."

\s5
\v 9 When the Lord Jesus had said these things, as they were looking up, he was raised up, and a cloud hid him from their eyes.
\v 10 While they were looking intensely to heaven as he went, suddenly, two men stood by them in white clothing.
\v 11 They said, "You men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking into heaven? This Jesus who ascended up into heaven will return in the same manner as you saw him going into heaven."

\s5
\p
\v 12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near to Jerusalem, a sabbath day’s journey.
\v 13 When they arrived, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were staying. They were Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon. the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.
\v 14 They were all united as one as they diligently continued in prayer.  Included were the women, Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.

\s5
\p
\v 15 In those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers, about 120 people, and said,
\v 16 "Brothers, it was necessary that the scripture should be fulfilled, that the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who guided the ones who arrested Jesus.

\s5
\v 17 For he was one of us and received his share of the benefits of this ministry."
\v 18 (Now this man bought a field with the earnings of his evil act. Then he fell head first, and his body burst wide open, and all his bowels poured out.
\v 19 It became known to all those living in Jerusalem that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.)

\s5
\v 20 For it is written in the book of Psalms,
\q Let his field be made desolate,
\q And do not let even one person live there.
\p and,
\q let someone else take his position of leadership.
\m

\s5
\v 21 It is necessary, therefore, that the men who accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
\v 22 beginning from the baptism of John to the day that he was taken up from us, one of these must be a witness with us of his resurrection."
\v 23 They put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas who was also named Justus, and Matthias.

\s5
\v 24 They prayed and said, "You, Lord, know the hearts of all people, so reveal which of these two is the one whom you have chosen
\v 25 to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas transgressed to go to his own place."
\v 26 They cast lots for them; and the lot fell to Matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.





\s5
\c 2
\p
\v 1 When the day of Pentecost came they were all together in the same place.
\v 2 Suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
\v 3 There appeared to them tongues like fire that were distributed, and they sat upon each one of them.
\v 4 They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other languages, as the Spirit gave them to speak.

\s5
\p
\v 5 Now there were Jews who were living in Jerusalem, godly men, from every nation under heaven.
\v 6 When this sound was heard, the multitude came together and was confused because everyone heard them speaking in his own language.
\v 7 They were amazed and marvelled; they said, "Really, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?

\s5
\v 8 Why is it that we are hearing them, each in our own language in which we were born?
\v 9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those who live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,
\v 10 in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, 
\v 11 Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians, we hear them telling in our languages  about the mighty works of God."

\s5
\v 12 They were all amazed and perplexed; they said to one another, "What does this mean?"
\v 13 But others mocked and said, "They are full of new wine."

\s5
\p
\v 14 But Peter stood with the eleven, raised his voice, and said to them, "Men of Judea and all you who live at Jerusalem, let be this known to you; pay attention to my words.
\v 15 For these people are not drunk as you assume, for it is only the third hour of the day.

\s5
\v 16 But this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:
\q
\v 17 'It will be in the last days,' God says,
\q 'I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,
\q Your sons and your daughters will prophesy.
\q And your young men will see visions
\q And your old men will dream dreams.

\s5
\q
\v 18 Also on my servants and my female servants in those days
\q I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy.
\q
\v 19 I will show wonders in the heaven above
\q And signs on the earth below,
\q Blood, fire, and vapor of smoke.

\s5
\q
\v 20 The sun will be turned to darkness
\q And the moon to blood,
\q Before the great and remarkable day of the Lord comes.
\q
\v 21 It will be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'
\m

\s5
\v 22 Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man authenticated by God to you by mighty deeds and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know—
\v 23 because of the determined plan and foreknowledge of God, he was delivered up, and you, by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed him;
\v 24 whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death from him, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.

\s5
\v 25 For David says about him,
\q   'I saw the Lord always before my face,
\q For he is beside my right hand so that I should not be moved.
\q
\v 26 Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced.
\q Also, my flesh will live in confidence.

\s5
\q
\v 27 For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,
\q Neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.
\q
\v 28 You revealed to me the ways of life;
\q You will make me full of gladness with your face.'
\m

\s5
\v 29 Brothers, I can speak to you confidently about the patriarch David: he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
\v 30 Therefore, he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that from the fruit of his loins he would set one upon his throne.
\v 31 He foresaw this and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ: 
    
\q he was neither abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see decay.
\m

\s5
\v 32 This Jesus—God raised him up, of which we all are witnesses.
\v 33 Therefore having been raised up to the right hand of God and having received the promised Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out this which you see and hear. 
\m

\s5
\v 34 For David did not ascend to the heaven, but he says,
\q "The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,
\q
\v 35 Until I make your enemies the stool for your feet."
\m
\v 36 Therefore, let all the house of Israel certainly know that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."

\s5
\p
\v 37 Now when they heard this they were pierced in their heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"
\v 38 And Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized, each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
\v 39 For to you is the promise and to your children and to all that are far off, as many people as the Lord our God will call."

\s5
\v 40 With many other words he testified and urged them; he said, "Save yourselves from this wicked generation."
\v 41 Then they received his word and were baptized, and there were added in that day about three thousand souls.
\v 42 They continued in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and in prayers.

\s5
\p
\v 43 Fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.
\v 44 All who believed were together and had all things in common,
\v 45 and they sold their property and possessions and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.

\s5
\v 46 So day after day they continued with one purpose in the Temple, and they broke bread in homes, and they shared food with joy and humility of heart;
\v 47 they praised God and had favor with all the people. The Lord added to them day by day those that were being saved.





\s5
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.
\v 2 A certain man, lame from birth, was carried every day and was laid at the door of the temple called Beautiful, so he could beg for alms from  the people who went into the temple.
\v 3 When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked for alms.

\s5
\v 4 Peter, fastening his eyes upon him, with John, said, "Look at us."
\v 5 The lame man looked at them, expecting to receive something from them.
\v 6 But Peter said, "Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have, I will give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk."

\s5
\v 7 Peter took him by the right hand, and raised him up: and immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength.
\v 8 Leaping up, the lame man stood and began to walk; and he entered with Peter and John into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God.

\s5
\v 9 All the people saw him walking and praising God.
\v 10 They noticed that it was the man who had been sitting to receive alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement because of what had happened to him.

\s5
\p
\v 11 As he was holding on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly marvelling.
\v 12 When Peter saw this, he answered the people, "You men of Israel, why do you marvel? Why do you  fix your eyes on us, as if we had made him to walk by our own power or godliness?

\s5
\v 13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. He is the one whom you delivered up and rejected before the face of Pilate, when he had decided to release him.
\v 14 You rejected the Holy and Righteous One, and you asked instead for a murderer to be released to you.

\s5
\v 15 You killed the Prince of life; whom God raised from the dead; and we are witnesses of this.
\v 16 Now faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, his faith which is in Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all.

\s5
\v 17 Now, brothers, I know that  you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
\v 18 But the things which God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he has now fulfilled.

\s5
\v 19 Repent, therefore, and turn, so that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come periods of refreshing from the presence of the Lord;
\v 20 and that he may send the Christ who has been appointed for you, Jesus.

\s5
\v 21 He is the One whom the heavens must receive and keep until the time of the restoration of all things, of which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been ever since ancient times.
\v 22 Moses indeed said, 'The Lord God will raise up a prophet like me from among your brothers. You shall listen to everything that he will speak to you.'
\v 23 It will happen that every person who does not listen to that prophet will be completely destroyed from among the people.

\s5
\v 24 Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those  who followed after him, all who spoke, they also told of these days.
\v 25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your ancestors, as he said to Abraham, 'In your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.'
\v 26 After God raised up his Servant, he sent him to you first, in order to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness."





\s5
\c 4
\p
\v 1 As Peter and John were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them.
\v 2 They were deeply troubled because Peter and John were teaching the people about Jesus and proclaiming his resurrection from the dead.
\v 3 They arrested them and put them in jail until the next morning, since  it was now evening.
\v 4 But many of the people who had heard the message believed; and the number of the men who believed was about five thousand.

\s5
\p
\v 5 It came about on the next day, that their rulers, elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem.
\v 6 Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and all who were of the relatives of the high priest.
\v 7 When they had set Peter and John in their midst, they asked them, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"

\s5
\v 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "You rulers of the people, and elders,
\v 9 if we this day are being questioned concerning a good deed done to a sick man— by what means was this man made well?
\v 10 May this be known to you all and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead— it is by him that  this man stands here healthy before you.

\s5
\v 11 Jesus Christ is the stone which you as builders despised but which has been made the head cornerstone.
\v 12 In no other person is there salvation: for there is no other name under heaven, that is given among men, by which we must be saved."

\s5
\p
\v 13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and realized that they were ordinary, uneducated men, they were surprised, becoming aware that Peter and John had been with Jesus.
\v 14 Because they saw the man who was healed standing with them, the Jewish leaders could say nothing against  them.

\s5
\v 15 But after they had commanded the apostles to leave the council meeting, they talked among themselves.
\v 16 They said, "What shall we do to these men? For the fact that a remarkable miracle has been done through them is known to everyone who lives in Jerusalem; we cannot deny it.
\v 17 But so it spreads no further among the people, let us warn them not to speak anymore to anyone in this name."
\v 18 They called Peter and John in and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.

\s5
\v 19 But Peter and John answered and said to them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to obey you rather than him,  you judge. 
\v 20 For we cannot help speaking about the things that we have seen and heard."

\s5
\v 21 After further warning Peter and John, they let them go. They were unable to find any excuse to punish them, because all of the people were praising God for what had been done.
\v 22 The man who had experienced this miracle of healing was more than forty years old.

\s5
\p
\v 23 After they were set free, Peter and John came to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
\v 24 When they heard it, they raised their voices together  to God and said, "Lord, you who made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them,
\v 25 you who by the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of our father David your servant, said, 
\q 'Why did the Gentile nations rage,
\q And the peoples imagine useless things?

\s5
\q
\v 26 The kings of the earth set themselves together,
\q And the rulers gathered together
\q Against the Lord, and against his Anointed One.' 
\m

\s5
\v 27 Indeed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, gathered together in this city against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed.   
\v 28 They gathered together  to do all that your hand and your desire decided in advance would happen.

\s5
\v 29 Now, Lord, look upon their warnings and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness.
\v 30 So that while you stretch out your hand to heal, signs and wonders may happen through the name of your holy Servant Jesus."
\v 31 When they finished praying, the place where they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.

\s5
\p
\v 32 The great number of those who believed were of one heart and soul: and not one of them said that anything he possessed was really his own; instead, they had all things in common.
\v 33 With great power the apostles were proclaiming their testimony about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.

\s5
\v 34 There was no person among them who lacked anything,  for all who owned title to lands or houses sold them and brought the money of the things that were sold
\v 35 and laid it at the apostles’ feet. And distribution was made to each believer, according as any one had need.

\s5
\p
\v 36 Joseph, a Levite, a man from Cyprus, was given the name Barnabas by the apostles.  (that is, being interpreted, Son of encouragement).
\v 37 Having a field, he sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.





\s5
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Now a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of property,
\v 2 and he kept back part of the sale money (his wife also knew it), and brought the other part of it and laid it at the apostles’ feet.

\s5
\v 3 But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the price of the land?
\v 4 While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your control? How is it that you thought of this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.
\v 5 Hearing these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last. And great fear came upon all who heard it.
\v 6 The young men came forward and wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him.

\s5
\p
\v 7 After about three hours, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
\v 8 Peter said to her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much."  She said, "Yes, for so much."

\s5
\v 9 Then Peter said to her, "How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."
\v 10 She instantly fell down at his feet, and breathed her last, and the young men came in and found her dead; they carried her out and buried her by her husband.
\v 11 Great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all who heard these things.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Many signs and wonders were taking place among the people through the hands of the apostles. They were all together in Solomon’s porch.
\v 13 But no one else had the courage to join them; however, they were held in high esteem by the people.

\s5
\v 14 Still more believers were being added to the Lord, multitudes of men and women,
\v 15 so that they even carried the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, so that as Peter came by his shadow might fall on some of them.
\v 16 There also came together a great number of people from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.

\s5
\p
\v 17 But the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees); and they were filled with jealousy
\v 18 and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in the public jail.

\s5
\v 19 Yet during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and led them out, and said,
\v 20 "Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life."
\v 21 When they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak and taught. But the high priest came, and those who were with him, and called the council together, all the elders of the people of Israel, and sent to the jail to have the apostles brought.

\s5
\v 22 But the officers that went did not find them in the prison, and they returned and reported,
\v 23 "We found the jail securely shut and the guards standing at the door, but when we had opened it, we found no one inside."

\s5
\v 24 Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed concerning them as to what would come of it.
\v 25 Then someone came and told them, "The men whom you put in the jail are standing in the temple and teaching the people."

\s5
\v 26 So the captain went with the officers, and brought them back, but without violence, for they feared that the people might stone them.
\v 27 When they had brought them, they set them before the council. The high priest interrogated them,
\v 28 saying, "We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and desire to bring this man’s blood upon us."

\s5
\v 29 But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than men.
\v 30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed, by hanging him on a tree.
\v 31 God exalted him to his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
\v 32 We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."

\s5
\p
\v 33 When the council members heard this, they were furious and wanted to kill the apostles.
\v 34 But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up and commanded the apostles be put outside for a little while.

\s5
\v 35 Then he said to them, "Men of Israel, pay close attention to what you propose to do with these people.
\v 36 For some time ago, Theudas rose up claiming to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was killed, and all who had been obeying him were scattered and came to nothing.
\v 37 After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him. He also perished, and all who had been obeying him were scattered.

\s5
\v 38 Now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or work is of men, it will be overthrown.
\v 39 But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them; you may even find that you are fighting against God." So they were persuaded.

\s5
\v 40  Then they called the apostles in and beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
\v 41 They left the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name.
\v 42 Thereafter every day, in the temple and from house to house, they were continuously teaching and to preaching Jesus as the Christ.





\s5
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Now in these days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint by the Grecian Jews began against the Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.

\s5
\v 2 The twelve apostles called the multitude of the disciples to them and said, "It is not right for us to give up the word of God in order to serve tables.
\v 3 You should therefore choose, brothers, seven men from among yourselves, men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
\v 4 As for us, we will always continue in prayer and in the ministry of the word."

\s5
\v 5 Their speech pleased the whole multitude. So they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch.
\v 6 The believers brought these men before the apostles, who prayed and then placed their hands upon them.

\s5
\p
\v 7 So the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; and a great number of the priests became obedient to the faith.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people.
\v 9 But there arose some people who belonged to the synagogue called the synagogue of the Freedmen, of the Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia. These people were debating with Stephen.

\s5
\v 10 But they were not able to stand against the wisdom and the Spirit with which Stephen spoke.
\v 11 Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, "We have heard Stephen speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God."

\s5
\v 12 They incited the people, the elders, and the scribes, and they confronted Stephen, seized him, and brought him to the council.
\v 13 They brought false witnesses, who said, "This man does not stop speaking words against this holy place and the law.
\v 14 For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us."
\v 15 Everyone who sat in the council fixed their eyes on him and saw his face was like the face of an angel.





\s5
\c 7
\p
\v 1 The high priest said, "Are these things true?"
\v 2 Stephen said,
\p "Brothers and fathers, listen to me: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran;
\v 3 he said to him, "Leave your land  and your relatives, and go into the land that I will show you.

\s5
\v 4 Then he left the land of the Chaldaeans and lived in Haran; from there, after his father died, God brought him into this land, where you live now.
\v 5 He gave none of it as an inheritance to him, no, not even enough to set a foot on. But he promised—even though Abraham had no child yet—that he would give the land as a possession to him and to his descendants after him.

\s5
\v 6 God was speaking to him like this, that his descendants would live for a while in a foreign land, and that the inhabitants there would bring them into slavery and treat them badly for four hundred years.
\v 7 'And I will judge the nation to which they will be slaves,' said God, 'and after that shall they will come out and worship me in this place.'
\v 8 And he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision, so Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of the twelve patriarchs.

\s5
\v 9 The patriarchs were motivated by jealousy against Joseph and sold him into Egypt, and God was with him,
\v 10 and rescued him from all his sufferings, and gave him favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Pharaoh then made him governor over Egypt and over all his household .

\s5
\v 11 Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan and great suffering: and our fathers found no food.
\v 12 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our forefathers the first time.
\v 13 At the second time Joseph showed himself to his brothers; and Joseph’s family became known to Pharaoh.

\s5
\v 14 Joseph sent his brothers back to tell Jacob his father to come to Egypt, along with all his relatives, seventy-five persons in all.
\v 15 So Jacob went down into Egypt; then he died, himself and our forefathers.
\v 16 They were carried over to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a price in silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.

\s5
\v 17 As the time of the promise drew near which God had promised to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
\v 18 until there arose another king over Egypt, a king who did not know about Joseph. 
\v 19 This same king deceived our people and ill-treated our forefathers, so they had to throw out their infants so they might not survive.

\s5
\v 20 At that time Moses was born; he was very beautiful before God and was nourished for three months in his father’s house.
\v 21 When he was thrown out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him over and raised him as her own son.

\s5
\v 22 Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works.
\v 23 But when he was about forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel.
\v 24 Seeing an Israelite being mistreated, Moses defended him and avenged him who was oppressed by striking the Egyptian:
\v 25 he thought that his brothers would understand that God by his hand was rescuing them, but they did not understand.

\s5
\v 26 On the next day he came to some Israelites as they were quarreling; he tried to put them at peace with each other; he said, 'Sirs, you are brothers; why do you wrong each other?'
\v 27 But the one who had wronged his neighbor pushed him away, and said, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
\v 28 Would you like to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'

\s5
\v 29 Moses ran away after hearing this; he became a foreigner in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.
\v 30 When forty years were past, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.

\s5
\v 31 When Moses saw the fire, he marvelled at the sight; and as he approached to look at it, there came a voice of the Lord, saying,
\v 32 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob.' Moses trembled  and did not dare to look.

\s5
\v 33 The Lord said to him, 'Take off your sandals, for the place you are standing on is holy ground.
\v 34 I have certainly seen the suffering of my people who are in Egypt; I have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them; now come, I will send you to Egypt.'

\s5
\v 35 This Moses whom they rejected, when they said, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'—he was the one whom God sent as both a ruler and deliverer. God sent him by the hand of the angel who appeared to Moses in the bush.
\v 36 Moses led them out of Egypt, after doing miracles and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness during forty years.
\v 37 It is the same Moses who said to the people of Israel, 'God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, a prophet like me.'

\s5
\v 38 This is the man who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel who had spoken to him on Mount Sinai. This is the man who was with our forefathers; this is the man who received living words to give to us.
\v 39 This is the man whom our forefathers refused to obey; they pushed him away from themselves, and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt.
\v 40 At that time they said to Aaron, 'Make us gods who will lead us. As for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.'

\s5
\v 41 So they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced because of the work of their hands.
\v 42 But God turned and gave them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets,
\q 'Did you offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices
\q For forty years in the wilderness, house of Israel?

\s5
\q
\v 43 You accepted the tabernacle of Molech
\q And the star of the god Rephan,
\q And the images that you made to worship them:
\q And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.'
\m

\s5
\v 44 Our forefathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, just as God  commanded when he spoke to Moses, that he should make it like the pattern that he had seen.
\v 45 This is the tent that our forefathers, in their turn, brought into the land with Joshua. This happened when they entered in on the possession of the nations that God drove out before the presence of our forefathers. It was like this until the days of David,
\v 46 who found favor in the sight of God; he asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.

\s5
\v 47 But Solomon built God a house.
\v 48 However, the Most High does not live in houses made with hands; it is like the prophet says,
\q
\v 49 'Heaven is my throne,
\q And the earth the footstool for my feet.
\q What kind of house can you build me? says the Lord:
\q Or where is the place for my rest?
\q
\v 50 Did not my hand make all these things?'

\s5
\p
\v 51 You people who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit; you act just as your forefathers acted.
\v 52 Which of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute? They killed the prophets who appeared in advance of the coming of the Righteous One; and you have now become the betrayers and murderers of him also,
\v 53 you people who received the law that angels had established, but you did not keep it "

\s5
\p
\v 54 Now when the council members heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they ground their teeth at Stephen.
\v 55 But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up intently up into heaven and saw the glory of God; and he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
\v 56 Stephen said, "Look, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."

\s5
\v 57 But the council members shouted out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him together;
\v 58 they threw him out of the city and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their outer clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.

\s5
\v 59 As they were stoning Stephen, he kept calling out to the Lord and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
\v 60 He knelt down and called out with a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." When he had said this, he
fell asleep.





\s5
\c 8
\v 1 Saul was in agreement with his death.
\p So there began on that day a great persecution against the church that was in Jerusalem; and the believers were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
\v 2 Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.
\v 3 But Saul greatly harmed the church; he went into house after house and dragged out men and women, and put them into prison.

\s5
\p
\v 4 Yet the believers who had been scattered went about preaching the word.
\v 5 Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ.

\s5
\v 6 When multitudes of people heard and saw the signs that Philip did, they paid attention together to what he said.
\v 7 For from many people who had them, unclean spirits came out while loudly crying out; and many paralyzed and lame people were healed.
\v 8 And there was much joy in that city.

\s5
\p
\v 9 But there was a certain man in the city named Simon, who had earlier been practicing sorcery; he used to astonish the people of Samaria, while claiming that he was an important person.
\v 10 All the Samaritans, from the least to the greatest, paid attention to him; they said, "This man is that power of God which is called Great."
\v 11  They listened to him, because he had astonished them for a long time with his sorceries.

\s5
\v 12 But when they believed what Philip preached about the gospel concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
\v 13 And Simon also himself believed: after he was baptized, he continued to be with Philip; when he saw signs and mighty deeds done, he was amazed.

\s5
\p
\v 14 Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John.
\v 15 When they had come down, they prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
\v 16 For until that time, the Holy Spirit had not come upon any of them; they had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
\v 17 Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

\s5
\v 18 Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money.
\v 19 He said, "Give me this power, too, that whoever I place my hands on might receive the Holy Spirit."

\s5
\v 20 But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish along with you, because you thought to obtain the gift of God with money.
\v 21 You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart is not right with God.
\v 22 Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord, so that he might perhaps forgive you for what you desired.
\v 23 For I see that you are in the poison of bitterness and in the bonds of sin."

\s5
\v 24 Simon answered and said, "Pray to the Lord for me, that none of the things which you have spoken of may happen to me."

\s5
\p
\v 25 When Peter and John had born witness and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem; along the way, they preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.

\s5
\p
\v 26 Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip and said, "Arise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." (This road is in a desert.)
\v 27 He arose and went. Behold, there was a man from Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. He was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship.
\v 28 He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.

\s5
\v 29 The Spirit said to Philip, "Go up and accompany this chariot."
\v 30 So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
\v 31 The Ethiopian said, "How can I, unless someone guides me?" He begged Philip to come up into the chariot and sit with him.

\s5
\v 32 Now the passage of the scripture which the Ethiopian was reading was this,
\q "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;
\q And as a lamb before his shearer is silent,
\q He does not open his mouth:
\q
\v 33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away:
\q Who will declare his generation?
\q For his life was taken from the earth."
\m

\s5
\v 34 So the eunuch asked Philip, and said, "I beg you, of whom is the prophet speaking? Of himself, or of some other person?"
\v 35 Philip began to speak; he started with this scripture in Isaiah to preach about Jesus to him.

\s5
\v 36 As they went on the road, they came to some water; the eunuch said, "Look, there is water here; what prevents me from being baptized?"
\v 37 \f + \ft The best ancient copies omit Acts 8:37, \fqa Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may be baptized." The Ethiopian answered, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." \f*
\v 38 So the Ethiopian commanded the chariot to stop. They went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and Philip baptized him.

\s5
\v 39 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away; the eunuch saw him no longer, and he went on his way rejoicing.
\v 40 But Philip appeared at Azotus. He passed through that region and preached the gospel to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.





\s5
\c 9
\p
\v 1 But Saul, still speaking threats even of murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
\v 2 and asked him for letters for the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

\s5
\v 3 As he was traveling, it happened that as he came near to Damascus, suddenly there shone all around him a light out of heaven;
\v 4 and he fell upon the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"

\s5
\v 5 Saul replied, "Who are you, Lord?" The Lord said, "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting;
\v 6 but rise, enter into the city, and it will be told you what you must do."
\v 7 The men who traveled with Saul stood speechless, hearing the voice, but seeing no one.

\s5
\v 8 Saul arose from the ground, and when he opened his eyes, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.
\v 9 For three days he was without sight, and he neither ate nor drank.

\s5
\p
\v 10 Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord spoke to him in a vision, "Ananias." And he said, "See, I am here, Lord."
\v 11 The Lord said to him, "Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and at the house of Judas ask for one named Saul, a man from Tarsus; for he is praying;
\v 12 and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and laying his hands on him, in order that he might receive his sight."

\s5
\v 13 But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to your people in Jerusalem.
\v 14 He has authority from the chief priests to arrest everyone here who calls upon your name."
\v 15 But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine, to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel;
\v 16 for I will show him how much he must suffer for the cause of my name."

\s5
*\v 17 So Ananias departed, and entered into the house. Laying his hands on him, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road when you were coming, has sent me so that you might receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
\v 18 Immediately something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he received his sight; he arose and was baptized;
\v 19 and he ate and was strengthened.
\p He stayed with the disciples in Damascus for several days.

\s5
\v 20 Right away he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues , saying that he is the Son of God.
\v 21 All who heard him were amazed and said, "Is not this the man who destroyed those in Jerusalem who called on this name? And he has come here in order to bring them bound to the chief priests."
\v 22 But Saul was empowered to preach and confuse the Jews that lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ.

\s5
\p
\v 23 After many days, the Jews planned together to kill him.
\v 24 But their plan became known to Saul. They watched the gates day and night in order to kill him.
\v 25 But his disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.

\s5
\p
\v 26 When he had come to Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he is a disciple.
\v 27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. And he told them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how at Damascus Saul had boldly preached in the name of Jesus.

\s5
\v 28 He met with them going in and going out in Jerusalem. He spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus \v 29 and debated with the Grecian Jews; but they kept trying to kill him.
\v 30 When the brothers learned of this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.

\s5
\p
\v 31 So then, the church throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and was built up; and, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, the church grew in numbers.
\v 32 Now it came about, as Peter went throughout the whole region, he came down also to God's people who lived in the town of Lydda.

\s5
\v 33 There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been in his bed for eight years, for he was paralyzed.
\v 34 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed." And right away he got up.
\v 35 So everyone who lived in Lydda and in Sharon saw the man and they turned to the Lord.

\s5
\p
\v 36 Now there was in Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which is translated as "Dorcas." This woman was full of good works and merciful deeds that she did for the poor.
\v 37 It came about in those days that she fell sick and died; when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.

\s5
\v 38 Since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him, begging him, "Come to us without delay."
\v 39 Peter arose and went with them. When he had arrived, they brought him to the upper room. And all the widows stood by him weeping, showing him the coats and garments that Dorcas had made while she had been with them.

\s5
\v 40 Peter put them all out of the room, knelt down, and prayed; then, turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, arise." She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up.
\v 41 Peter then gave her his hand and lifted her up; and when he called the believers and the widows, he presented her alive to them.
\v 42 This matter became known throughout all Joppa, and many people believed on the Lord.
\v 43 It happened that Peter stayed for many days in Joppa with a man named Simon, a tanner.





\s5
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now there was a certain man in the city of Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort.
\v 2 He was a devout man, one who worshiped God with all his household; he gave much money to the Jewish people and was always praying to God.

\s5
\v 3  About the ninth hour of the day, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him. The angel said to him, "Cornelius!"
\v 4 Cornelius stared at the angel and was very frightened and said, "What is it, sir?" The angel said to him, "Your prayers and your gifts to the poor have gone up as a memorial offering into God's presence."

\v 5 Now send men to the city of Joppa to bring a man named Simon, who is also named Peter.
\v 6 He is staying with a tanner named Simon, whose house is by the seaside."

\s5
\v 7 When the angel who spoke to him had left, Cornelius called two of his house servants, and a soldier who worshiped God from among the soldiers who were also serving him.
\v 8 Cornelius told them all that had happened and sent them to Joppa.

\s5
\p
\v 9 Now on the next day at about the sixth hour, as they were on their journey and drew near to the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray.
\v 10 He then became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while the people were cooking some food, he fell into a trance;
\v 11 and he saw the sky open and a certain container descending, something like a large sheet coming down to the earth, let down by its four corners.
\v 12 In it were all kinds of four-footed animals and things that crawled on the earth, and birds of the sky.

\s5
\v 13 Then a voice spoke to him: "Rise, Peter, kill and eat."
\v 14 But Peter said, "Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that was defiled and unclean."
\v 15 But the voice came to him again a second time: "What God has cleansed, do not call it defiled."
\v 16 This happened three times; then the container was immediately taken back up into the sky.

\s5
\p
\v 17 Now while Peter was very confused about what the vision that he had seen could mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius stood before the gate, after they had asked their way to the house.
\v 18 And they called out and asked whether Simon, who was also called Peter, was staying there.

\s5
\v 19 While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "See, three men are looking for you.
\v 20 Arise and go down and go with them. Do not fear to go with them, because I have sent them."
\v 21 So Peter went down to the men and said, "I am he whom you are seeking. Why have you come?"

\s5
\v 22 They said, "A centurion named Cornelius, a righteous man and one who worships God, and is well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was told by a holy angel of God to send for you to come to his house, so he could listen to a message from you."
\v 23 So Peter invited them to come in and stay with him and the people with him.
\p On the next morning he got up and went with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.

\s5
\v 24 On the following day they came to Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them; he had called together his relatives and his close friends.

\s5
\v 25 It came about that when Peter entered, Cornelius met him and bowed down at his feet to honor him.
\v 26 But Peter raised him up and said, "Stand up; I myself also am only a man."

\s5
\v 27 While Peter was talking with him, he went in and found many people gathered together.
\v 28 He said to them, "You yourselves know that it is not lawful for a Jewish man to associate with or to visit someone from another nation. But God has shown me that I should not call any man defiled or unclean.
\v 29 That is why I came without arguing, when I was sent for. So I ask you why you sent for me."

\s5
\v 30 Cornelius said, "Four days ago at this very hour, I was praying at the ninth hour in my house; and see, a man stood before me in bright clothing.
\v 31 He said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard by God, and your gifts to the poor have reminded God about you.
\v 32 So send someone to Joppa, and call to you a man named Simon, who is also called Peter. He is staying in the house of a tanner named Simon, by the seaside.'
\f + \ft Some ancient authorities add:
\fqa When he comes, he will speak to you. \f*

\v 33 So at once I sent for you. You are kind to have come. Now then, we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear everything that you have been instructed by the Lord to say."
\f + \ft Some ancient authorities add:
\fqa instructed by God to say. \f*

\s5
\v 34 Then Peter opened his mouth and said, 
\p "Truly, I perceive that God does not take anyone's side.
\v 35 Instead,  in every nation anyone who worships and does righteous deeds is acceptable to him.

\s5
\v 36 You know the message that he sent to the people of Israel, when he announced good news about peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all—
\v 37 you yourselves know the events that took place, which were occurred throughout all Judea, beginning in Galilee, after the baptism that John announced;
\v 38 the events concerning Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.

\s5
\v 39 We are witnesses of all things that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem—this Jesus whom they killed, hanging him on a tree.
\v 40 This man God raised up on the third day and gave him to be made known,
\v 41 not to all the people, but to the witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God—we ourselves, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.

\s5
\v 42 He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that this is the one who has been chosen by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.
\v 43 It is to him that all the prophets bear witness, so that everyone who believes in him shall receive forgiveness of sins through his name."

\s5
\p
\v 44 While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all of those who were listening to his message.
\v 45 The people who belonged to the circumcision group of believers—all of those who came with Peter—were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out also on the Gentiles.

\s5
\v 46 For they heard these Gentiles speak in other languages and praising God. Then Peter answered,
\v 47 "Can anyone keep water from these people so they should not be baptized, these people who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?"
\v 48 Then he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay with them for several days.





\s5
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
\v 2 When Peter had come up to Jerusalem, they who belonged to the circumcision group criticized him;
\v 3 they said, "You associated with uncircumcised men and ate with them!"

\s5
\v 4 But Peter started to explain the matter to them in detail; he said,
\v 5 I was praying in the city of Joppa, and in a trance I saw a vision of a container coming down, like a large sheet let down from heaven by its four corners; it descended to me
\v 6 I gazed at it and I thought about it; I saw the four-legged animals of earth, wild beasts, creeping animals, and birds of the sky.

\s5
\v 7 Then I heard  a voice say to me, "Get up, Peter; kill and eat!"
\v 8 I said, "Not so, Lord: for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth."
\v 9 But the voice answered again from heaven, "What God has declared clean do not call unclean."
\v 10 This happened three times, and then everything was taken back up into heaven again.

\s5
\v 11 Behold, right away there were three men standing in front of the house where we were; they had been sent from Caesarea to me.
\v 12 The Spirit commanded me go with them, and that I should make no distinction regarding them. These six brothers went with me, and we went into the man’s house.
\v 13 He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, "Send men to Joppa and bring back Simon, whose other name is Peter.
\v 14 He will speak to you a message by which you will be saved—you and all your household."

\s5
\v 15 As I began to speak to them, the Holy Spirit came on them, just as on us in the beginning.
\v 16 I remembered the words of the Lord, how he said, "John indeed baptized with water; but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit."

\s5
\v 17 Then if God gave to them the same  gift as he gave to us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could oppose God?"
\v 18 When they heard these things, they said nothing in response, but they praised God and said, "Then God has given repentance for life to the Gentiles also."

\s5
\p
\v 19 Therefore the believers whom the suffering that began with Stephen's death scattered away from Jerusalem—hese believers went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch. They told the message about Jesus only to Jews, to no one else. 
\v 20 But some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene came to Antioch and spoke to Greeks also and preached the Lord Jesus.
\v 21 And the hand of the Lord was with them; a great number believed and turned to the Lord.

\s5
\v 22 News about them came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem: and they sent out Barnabas as far as Antioch.
\v 23 When he came and saw the gift of God, he was glad; and he encouraged them all to remain with the Lord with all their heart.
\v 24 For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Lord.

\s5
\v 25 Barnabas then went out to Tarsus to look for Saul.
\v 26 When he found him, he brought him to Antioch. It came about, that for an entire year they gathered together with the church and taught many people. The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.

\s5
\p
\v 27 Now in these days some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
\v 28 One of them, Agabus by name, stood up and indicated by the Spirit that a great famine would occur over all the world. This happened in the days of Claudius. 

\s5
\v 29 So, the disciples, as each one was able, decided to send help to the brothers in Judea.
\v 30 They did this; they sent money to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.







\s5
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some of those from the assembly to mistreat them.
\v 2 He killed James the brother of John with the sword.

\s5
\v 3 After he saw that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. That was during the days of unleavened bread.
\v 4 After arresting him, he put him in prison and assigned four squads of soldiers to guard him; he was intending to bring him to the people after the Passover.

\s5
\v 5 So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer was made earnestly by the assembly to God for him.
\v 6 The day before Herod was going to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and guards in front of the door were watching over the prison.

\s5
\v 7 Behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared by him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him and said, "Get up quickly." Then his chains fell off from his hands.
\v 8 The angel said to him, "Dress yourself and put on your sandals." Peter did so. The angel said to him, "Put on your outer garment and follow me."

\s5
\v 9 So Peter followed the angel and went out. He did not know that what was done by the angel was real. He thought he was seeing a vision.
\v 10 After they had passed by the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate that led into the city; it opened for them by itself. They went out and went down a street, and the angel left him right away.

\s5
\v 11 When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I truly know that the Lord has sent his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews."
\v 12 After he realized this, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark; many believers had gathered there and were praying.

\s5
\v 13 When he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer.
\v 14 When she recognized Peter’s voice, out of joy she failed to open the door; instead, she came running into the room; she reported that Peter was standing at the door.
\v 15 So they said to her, "You are insane." But she insisted that it was so. They said, "It is his angel."

\s5
\v 16 But Peter continued knocking, and when they had opened the door, they saw him and were amazed.
\v 17 Peter motioned to them with his hand to be silent, and he told them how the Lord had brought him out of prison. He said, "Report these things to James and the brothers." Then he left and went to another place.

\s5
\v 18 Now when it became day, there was no small excitement among the soldiers, regarding what had happened to Peter.
\v 19 After Herod had searched for him and could not find him, he questioned the guards and ordered them to be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.

\s5
\p
\v 20 Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They went to him together. They persuaded Blastus, the king’s assistant, to help them. Then they asked for peace, because their country received its food from the king’s country.
\v 21 On a set day Herod dressed himself in royal clothing and sat on a throne; he made a speech to them.

\s5
\v 22 The people shouted, "This is the voice of a god, not of a man!"
\v 23 Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory; he was eaten by worms and died.

\s5
\p
\v 24 But the word of God grew and multiplied.
\p
\v 25 After Barnabas and Saul completed their mission to Jerusalem, they returned; they took with them John, whose surname was Mark.





\s5
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Now in the assembly in Antioch, there were some prophets and teachers. They were Barnabas, Symeon (called Niger), Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch), and Saul.
\v 2 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, to do the work to which I have called them."
\v 3 After the assembly had fasted, prayed, and laid their hands on these men, they sent them off.

\s5
\p
\v 4 So Barnabas and Saul obeyed the Holy Spirit and went down to Seleucia;  from there they sailed to the island of Cyprus.
\v 5 When they were in the city of Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John Mark as their assistant.

\s5
\v 6 When they had gone through the whole island to Paphos, they found a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, whose name was Bar Jesus.
\v 7 This magician associated with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, because he wanted to hear the word of God.
\v 8 But Elymas "the magician" (that is how his name is translated) opposed them; he tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.

\s5
\v 9 But Saul, who is also called Paul, was filled with the Holy Spirit; he gazed at him
\v 10 and said, "You son of the devil, you are full of all kinds of deceit and wickedness. You are an enemy of every kind of righteousness. You will never stop twisting the straight paths of the Lord, will you?

\s5
\v 11 Now look, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will become blind. You will not see the sun for a while." Immediately there fell on Elymas a mist and darkness; he started going around asking people to lead him by the hand.
\v 12 After the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, because he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord.

\s5
\p
\v 13 Now Paul and his friends set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. But John left them and returned to Jerusalem.
\v 14 Paul and his friends travelled from Perga and came to Antioch of Pisidia. There they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down.
\v 15 After the reading of the law and the prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent them a message saying, "Brothers, if you have any message of encouragement for the people here, say it."

\s5
\v 16 So Paul stood up and motioned with his hand; he said, "Men of Israel and you who honor God, listen.
\v 17 The God of this people Israel chose our forefathers and made the people numerous when they stayed in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm he led them out of it.
\v 18 For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.

\s5
\v 19 After he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave our people their land for an inheritance.  
\v 20 All these events took place over four hundred and fifty years. After all these things, God gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.

\s5
\v 21 After this, the people asked for a king, so God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the time of forty years.
\v 22 Then after God removed him from the kingship, he raised up David to be their king. It was about David that God said, 'I have found David the son of Jesse to be a man after my heart; he shall do everything I desire.'

\s5
\v 23 From this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised to do.
\v 24 This began to happen when, before Jesus came,  John first announced the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
\v 25 As John was finishing his work, he said, 'Who do you think I am? I am not the one. But listen, one is coming after me, the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'

\s5
\v 26 Brothers, children of the line of Abraham, and those among you who worship God, it is to us that the message about this salvation has been sent.
\v 27 For they who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers, did not really know him, nor did they really understand the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath; so they fulfilled the prophets' messages by condemning Jesus to death.

\s5
\v 28 Even though they found no good cause for death in him, they asked Pilate to kill him.
\v 29 When they had completed all the things that were written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.

\s5
\v 30 But God raised him from the dead.
\v 31 He was seen for many days by those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. These people are now his witnesses to the people.

\s5
\v 32 So we are bringing you good news about the promises made to our forefathers:
\v 33 God has kept these promises to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus from the dead. This is also what was written in the second psalm:
\q 'You are my Son, today I have become your Father.'
\v 34 Also about the fact that he raised him up from the dead so that his body will not decay, he has spoken like this: 
\q 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'

\s5
\v 35 This is why he also says in another psalm, 
\q 'You will not allow your Holy One to experience decay.'
\v 36 For after David had in his own generation served the desires of God, he fell asleep, was laid with his fathers, and experienced decay,
\v 37 but he whom God raised up experienced no decay.

\s5
\v 38 So let it be known to you, brothers, that through this man is proclaimed to you forgiveness of sins.
\v 39 By him every one who believes is justified from all the things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.

\s5
\v 40 So then be careful that the thing the prophets spoke about does not happen to you:
\q
\v 41 'Look, you despisers, and be astonished and then perish;
\q For I am doing a work in your days,
\q A work that you shall never believe, even if someone announces it to you.'"

\s5
\p
\v 42 As Paul and Barnabas left, the people begged them that they might speak these same words again the next Sabbath. 
\v 43 When the synagogue meeting ended, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.

\s5
\p
\v 44 On the next Sabbath, almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of the Lord.
\v 45 When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and spoke against the things that were said by Paul and insulted him.

\s5
\v 46 But Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, "It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing you push it away from yourselves and consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life, see, we will turn to the Gentiles.
\v 47 For so has the Lord commanded us, saying,
\q 'I have placed you as a light for the Gentiles,
\q That you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.'"
\m

\s5
\v 48 As the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and praised the word of the Lord. As many as were appointed to eternal life believed.
\v 49 The word of the Lord was spread out throughout the whole region.

\s5
\v 50 But the Jews urged on the devout and important women, as well as the leading men of the city. These stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them out beyond the border of their city. 
\v 51 But Paul and Barnabas shook off the dust from their feet against them. Then they went to the city of Iconium.
\v 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.





\s5
\c 14
\p
\v 1 It came about in Iconium that Paul and Barnabas entered together into the synagogue of the Jews and spoke in such a way that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.
\v 2 But the Jews who were disobedient stirred up the minds of the Gentiles and made them bitter against the brothers.

\s5
\v 3 So they stayed there for a long time, speaking boldly with the Lord's power, while he gave evidence about the message about his grace. He did this by granting signs and wonders to be done by the hands of Paul and Barnabas.
\v 4 But the majority of the city was divided: some people  sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.

\s5
\v 5 When both Gentiles and Jews attempted to persuade their leaders to mistreat and stone Paul and Barnabas,
\v 6 they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region,
\v 7 and there they were preaching the gospel.

\s5
\p
\v 8 At Lystra a certain man sat, powerless in his feet, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked.
\v 9 This man heard Paul speaking. Paul fixed his eyes on him and saw that he had faith to be made well.
\v 10 So he said to him in a loud voice, "Stand up on your feet." And the man jumped up and walked around.

\s5
\v 11 When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they raised their voice, saying in the dialect of Lycaonia, "The gods have come down to us in the form of men."
\v 12 They called Barnabas "Zeus," and Paul, "Hermes,"  because he was the main speaker.
\v 13 The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and wreaths to the gates; he and the multitudes wanted to offer sacrifice.

\s5
\v 14 But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothing and quickly went out into the crowd, crying out
\v 15 and saying, "Men, why are you doing these things? We also are human beings with the same feelings as you. We bring you good news, that you should turn from these useless things to a living God, who made the heavens, the earth, and the sea and everything that is in them.
\v 16 In the past ages, he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.

\s5
\v 17 But still,  he did not leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you the heavens' rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness."
\v 18 Even with these words, Paul and Barnabas barely kept the multitudes from sacrificing to them.

\s5
\p
\v 19 But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came and persuaded the crowds. They stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, thinking that he was dead.
\v 20 Yet as the disciples were standing around him, he got up and entered the city. The next day, he went to Derbe with Barnabas. 

\s5
\v 21 After they had preached the gospel in that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, to Iconium, and to Antioch.
\v 22 They kept strengthening the minds of the disciples and encouraging them to continue in the faith. They told them that it is through many sufferings that we must enter into the kingdom of God.

\s5
\v 23 When they had appointed for them elders in every assembly of believers, and had prayed with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord, in whom they had believed.
\v 24 Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.
\v 25 When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
\v 26 From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had now completed.

\s5
\v 27 When they arrived in Antioch and gathered the assembly together, they reported all the things that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles. 
\v 28 They stayed for a long time with the disciples.





\s5
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Certain men came down from Judea and taught the brothers, saying, "Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."
\v 2 When Paul and Barnabas had a confrontation and debate with them, the brothers decided that Paul, Barnabas, and certain others should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.

\s5
\v 3 They therefore, being sent by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria and announced the conversion of the Gentiles;  they brought great joy to all the brothers.
\v 4 When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all the things that God had done with them.

\s5
\v 5 But certain men who believed, who belonged to the group of Pharisees, stood up and said, "It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses."
\v 6 So the apostles and the elders gathered together to consider this matter.

\s5
\v 7 After much debate, Peter stood up and said to them,
\p "Brothers, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
\v 8 God, who knows the heart, witnesses to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us;
\v 9 and he made no distinction between us and them, making their hearts clean by faith.

\s5
\v 10 Now therefore why do you test God, that you should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
\v 11 But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they were."

\s5
\p
\v 12 All the multitude kept silent while they listened to Barnabas and Paul report the signs and wonders God had worked among the Gentiles through them.

\s5
\v 13 After they stopped speaking, James answered, saying,
\p "Brothers, listen to me.
\v 14 Simon has told how God first graciously helped the Gentiles in order to take from them a people for his name.

\s5
\v 15 The words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written, 
\q
\v 16 After these things I will return,
\q And I will build again the tent of David, which has fallen down;
\q I will set up and restore its ruins again,
\q
\v 17 So that the remnant of men may seek the Lord,
\q  including all the Gentiles called by my name.
\q
\v 18 This is what the Lord says, who makes these ancient things known.
\m

\s5
\v 19 Therefore, my opinion is, that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God;
\v 20 but that we write to them that they must keep from the pollution of idols, from sexual immorality, and from what is strangled, and from blood.
\v 21 For Moses from generations of old has people in every city who are preaching and reading him in the synagogues every Sabbath."

\s5
\p
\v 22 Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose Judas Barsabbas and Silas, leaders of the church, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas.
\v 23 They wrote this,  "The apostles, the elders and brothers, to the Gentile brothers  in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia, greetings.

\s5
\v 24 We have heard that certain men to whom we gave no such commandment, went out from us and have troubled you with teachings that make trouble for your souls.
\v 25  So it seemed good to all of us to agree to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
\v 26 people who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

\s5
\v 27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who will also tell you the same things 
\v 28 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:
\v 29 that you turn away from things sacrificed to idols, blood, things strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, it shall be well with you. Farewell."

\s5
\p
\v 30 So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; after they gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.
\v 31 When they had read it, they rejoiced because of the encouragement.
\v 32 Judas and Silas, also prophets, encouraged the brothers with many words and strengthened them.

\s5
\v 33 After they had spent some time there, they were sent away in peace from the brothers to those who had sent them.
\v 34 \f + \ft The best ancient copies omit verse 34 (see Acts 15:40). Vs. 34, \fqa But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.\f*
\v 35 But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch along with many others, where they taught and preached the word of the Lord.

\s5
\p
\v 36 After some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return now and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.
\v 37 Barnabas wanted to also take with them John who was called Mark.
\v 38 But Paul thought it not good to take Mark, who had withdrawn from them from Pamphylia and did not go further with them in the work.

\s5
\v 39 Then there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.
\v 40 But Paul chose Silas and left, after he was entrusted by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.
\v 41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.





\s5
\c 16
\p
\v 1 Paul also came to Derbe and to Lystra; and behold, a certain disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a Jewish woman who believed; his father was a Greek.
\v 2 He was well spoken of by the brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium.
\v 3 Paul wanted him  to travel with him; so he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.

\s5
\v 4 As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to the churches the instructions for them to obey, the instructions that had been written by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.
\v 5 So the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in number daily.

\s5
\p
\v 6 Paul and his companions went through the regions of Phrygia and Galatia, since they had been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in the province of Asia.
\v 7 When they came near Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus prevented them.
\v 8 So passing by Mysia, they came down to the city of Troas.

\s5
\v 9 A vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, calling him and saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us."
\v 10 When Paul had seen the vision, immediately we set out to go to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.

\s5
\p
\v 11 Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day we came to Neapolis;
\v 12 From there we went to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the most important city in the district and a Roman colony, and we stayed in this city for  several days.
\v 13 On the Sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river, where we thought there would be a place of prayer.  We sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.

\s5
\v 14 A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God, listened to us. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to the things which were spoken by Paul.
\v 15 When she was baptized, and her household, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and stay there." And she persuaded us.

\s5
\v 16 It came about that, as we were going to the place of prayer, a certain young woman who had a spirit of divination encountered us—she brought her masters much gain by fortunetelling.
\v 17 This woman followed after Paul and us and shouted, saying, "These men are servants of the Most High God. They proclaim to you the way of salvation."
\v 18 She did this for many days. But Paul, being greatly annoyed by her, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out right away.

\s5
\p
\v 19 When her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities.
\v 20 When they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, "These men are Jews and are making a lot of trouble in our city.
\v 21 They are teaching  things that are not lawful for us to receive or to observe as Romans."

\s5
\v 22 Then the crowd rose up together against Paul and Silas; the magistrates tore their garments off them and commanded them to be beaten with rods.
\v 23 When they had laid many blows upon them, they threw them into prison and commanded the jailer to keep them securely.
\v 24 After he got this command, the jailer threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.

\s5
\v 25 Around midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.
\v 26 Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's chains were unfastened.

\s5
\v 27 The jailer was awakend from sleep and saw the open prison doors; he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, because he thought that the prisoners had escaped.
\v 28 But Paul shouted with a loud voice, saying, "Do not harm  yourself, because we are all here."

\s5
\v 29 The jailer called for lights and rushed in and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,
\v 30 and brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
\v 31 They said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your house."

\s5
\v 32 They spoke the word of the Lord to him, together with everyone in his house.
\v 33 Then the jailer took them at the same hour of the night, and washed their wounds, and he and all his household were baptized immediately.
\v 34 He brought Paul and Silas up into his house and set food before them. He rejoiced greatly with all his household, because they had all believed in God.

\s5
\p
\v 35 Now when it was day, the magistrates sent word to the guards saying, "Let those men go."
\v 36 The jailer reported the words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates have sent word to me to let you go: now therefore come out , and go in peace."

\s5
\v 37 But Paul said to them, "They have publicly beaten us, men who are uncondemned Romans, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now drive us out secretly? No indeed; let them come themselves and bring us out."
\v 38 The guards reported these words to the magistrates; the magistrates were afraid when they heard that Paul and Silas were Romans.
\v 39 The magistrates came and begged them; and when they had brought them out of prison, they asked Paul and Silas to leave the city.

\s5
\v 40 So Paul and Silas went out of the prison and came to the house of Lydia.  When Paul and Silas saw the brothers, they encouraged them and then departed from the city.



 

\s5
\c 17
\p
\v 1 Now when they had passed through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to the city of Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
\v 2 Paul, as his custom was, went to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures.

\s5
\v 3 He was opening the Scriptures and explaining that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise again from the dead. He said, "This Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Christ."
\v 4 Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas,  including the devout Greeks, many of the leading women  and a great crowd.

\s5
\v 5 But the unbelieving Jews, being moved with jealousy, took certain wicked men from the marketplace, gathered a crowd together, and set the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Jason, they wanted to bring Paul and Silas out to the people.
\v 6 But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and certain other brothers before the officials of the city, crying, "These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also.
\v 7 These men whom Jason has welcomed act against the decrees of Caesar; they say that there is another king—Jesus."

\s5
\v 8 When the crowd and the officials of the city heard these things, they were troubled.
\v 9 After they had taken financial security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.

\s5
\p
\v 10 That night the brothers sent Paul and Silas to Berea.  When they arrived there, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.
\v 11 Now these people were of a higher mind than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.
\v 12 Therefore many of them believed, including some influential Greek women and many men.

\s5
\v 13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that Paul was also proclaiming the word of God at Berea, they went there and stirred up and troubled the crowds.
\v 14 Then immediately, the brothers sent Paul to go to the sea, but Silas and Timothy stayed there.
\v 15 Those who were leading Paul took him as far as the city of  Athens. As they left Paul there, they received from him instructions for Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible. 

\s5
\p
\v 16 Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols.
\v 17 So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and those who worshipped God and  also with those he met  every day in the marketplace.

\s5
\v 18 But also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, "What is this babbler trying to say?"
Others said, "He seems to be a preacher of strange gods," because he was preaching about Jesus and the resurrection.

\s5
\v 19 They took Paul and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know this new teaching which you were speaking?
\v 20 For you bring some strange things to our ears. Therefore, we want to know what these things mean."
\v 21 (Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing but either telling or listening about something new.)

\s5
\v 22 So Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus and said,
\p "You men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in every way.
\v 23 For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you.

\s5
\v 24 The God who made the world and everything in it, since he is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples built with hands.
\v 25 Neither is he served by men’s hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives people life and breath and everything else.

\s5
\v 26 And from one man he made every nation of people living on the surface of the earth, having determined their appointed seasons and the boundaries of their living areas.
\v 27 Therefore, they should seek God and perhaps they might reach out to him and find him, and indeed, he is not far from any one of us.

\s5
\v 28 For in him we live and move and have our being, just as one of your own poets has said,
\p 'For we also are his offspring.'
\v 29 Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the divinity is like gold, or silver, or stones, sculptured with the art and thought of man.

\s5
\v 30 Therefore God overlooked the times of ignorance, but now he commands  all men everywhere to repent.
\v 31 This is because he has set a day when he will judge the world in righteousness by the man he has chosen.  God  has given proof of this man to everyone by raising him from the dead."

\s5
\p
\v 32 Now when the men of Athens heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked Paul; but others said, "We will listen to you again about this matter."
\v 33 After that, Paul left them,
\v 34 But certain men joined him and believed, including Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris,   and others with them.





\s5
\c 18
\p
\v 1 After these things Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.
\v 2 There he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race; he had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome; and Paul came to them;
\v 3 Paul lived and worked with  them because he was of the same trade. They were tentmakers.

\s5

\v 4 So Paul reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath. He persuaded both Jews and Greeks.
\v 5 But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit to testify to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
\v 6 When the Jews opposed and insulted him, Paul shook out his garment at them and said to them, "May your blood be upon your own heads; I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."

\s5
\v 7 Then he left from there and went to the house of Titius Justus, a man who worshiped God. His house was next to the synagogue.
\v 8 Crispus, the head of the synagogue and all of his house believed in the Lord. Many of the Corinthians who heard  Paul believed and were baptized.

\s5
\v 9 The Lord said to Paul in the night in a vision, "Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent.
\v 10 For I am with you, and no one will try to harm you, for I have many people in this city."
\v 11 Paul lived there for a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.

\s5
\p
\v 12 But when Gallio became governor of Achaia, the Jews rose up together against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat;
\v 13 they said, "This man persuades people to worship God contrary to the law."

\s5

\v 14 Yet when Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, "You Jews, if indeed it were a matter of wrong or a crime, it would be reasonable to deal with you.
\v 15 But since these are questions about words and names and your own law, settle it yourselves. I do not wish to be a judge of these matters."

\s5
\v 16 Gallio made them leave the judgment seat.
\v 17 But they all took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, by force, and beat him in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio did not care what they did. 

\s5
\p
\v 18 Paul, after staying there for many more days, left the brothers and sailed for Syria with Priscilla and Aquila. Before he left the seaport, Cenchreae, he had his head shaved because he had taken a Nazarite vow.
\v 19 When they came to Ephesus, Paul left Priscilla and Aquila there, but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.

\s5
\v 20 When they asked Paul to stay a longer time, he declined.
\v 21 But taking his leave of them, he said, "I will return again to you if it is God's will." He then set sail from Ephesus.

\s5
\p
\v 22 When Paul had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the Jerusalem church and then went down to Antioch.
\v 23 After having spent some time there, Paul departed and went through the regions of Galatia and Phrygia and encouraged all the disciples.

\s5
\p
\v 24 Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, came to Ephesus. He was eloquent in speech and mighty in the Scriptures.
\v 25 Apollos had been instructed in the teachings of the Lord. Being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, but he knew  only the baptism of John.
\v 26 Apollos began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they befriended him and explained to him the way of God more accurately.

\s5
\v 27 When he desired to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples in Achaia to welcome him.  When he arrived, he greatly helped those who believed by grace. 
\v 28 Apollos publicly overwhelmed the Jews with his power and skill, showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.





\s5
\c 19
\p
\v 1 It came about that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to the city of Ephesus, and found certain disciples there.
\v 2 Paul said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They said to him, "No, we did not even hear about the Holy Spirit."

\s5
\v 3 Paul said, "Into what then were you baptized?" They said, "Into John’s baptism."
\v 4 So Paul replied, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance. He told the people that they should believe on the one who would come after him, that is, on Jesus."

\s5
\v 5 When the people heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
\v 6 Then when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke in other languages and prophesied.
\v 7 In all they were about twelve men.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Paul went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for the space of three months. He was leading discussions and persuading people about the things concerning the kingdom of God.
\v 9 But when some Jews were hardened and disobedient, they began to speak evil of the way of Christ before the crowd, so Paul left them, and drew the believers away from them. He began to speak every day in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
\v 10 This continued for two years, so that all who  lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.

\s5
\v 11 God was doing mighty deeds by the hands of Paul,
\v 12 so that even the sick were healed, and evil spirits went out of people, when they took  handkerchiefs and aprons from Paul's body. 

\s5
\v 13 But there were Jewish exorcists travelling through the area who took the name of Jesus for their own use. They spoke it over those who had evil spirits; they said, “I command you by Jesus who Paul preaches to leave.”
\v 14 Those who did this were the seven sons of a Jewish chief priest, Sceva.

\s5
\v 15 An evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?"
\v 16 The evil spirit in the man leaped on the exorcists and overpowered them and beat them up. Then they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
\v 17 This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. They became very afraid, and the name of the Lord Jesus was honored.

\s5
\v 18 Also, many of the believers came and confessed and admitted the evil things they had done.
\v 19  Many who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of everyone. When they counted the value of them, it was fifty thousand pieces of silver.
\v 20 So the word of the Lord spread very widely in powerful ways.

\s5
\p
\v 21 Now after Paul completed his ministry in Ephesus, he decided in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia on his way to Jerusalem; he said, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
\v 22 Paul sent  to Macedonia two of his disciples, Timothy and Erastus, who had helped him. But he himself stayed in Asia for a while.

\s5
\p
\v 23 At about that time there arose a great disturbance in Ephesus concerning the Way.
\v 24 A certain silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver statues of Diana, brought in much business for the craftsmen.
\v 25 So he gathered together the workmen of that occupation and said, "Sirs, you know that in this business we make much money.

\s5
\v 26 You see and hear that, not only at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people.  He is saying that there are no gods that are made with hands.
\v 27 And not only is there danger that our trade will no longer be needed, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana may be considered worthless.  Then she would even lose her greatness, she whom all Asia and the world worships."

\s5
\v 28 When they heard this they were filled with anger and cried out, saying, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians."
\v 29 The whole city was filled with confusion, and the people rushed together into the theater.  They had seized Paul's travel companions, Gaius and Aristarchus, who came from Macedonia. 

\s5
\v 30  Paul wanted to enter in among the crowd of people, but the disciples prevented him.
\v 31  Also, some of the local officials who were friends of Paul sent word to him  asking him not to enter  the theater.
\v 32 Some people were shouting one thing, and some another, for the crowd was in confusion. Most of them did not even know why they had come together.

\s5
\v 33 The Jews brought Alexander out of the crowd  putting him up front of the people. Alexander motioned with his hand to make an explanation to the people.
\v 34 But when they realized that he was a Jew, they all cried out with one voice for about two hours, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians."

\s5
\v 35 When the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, "You men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Diana and of the image which fell down from heaven?
\v 36 Seeing then that these things are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.
\v 37 For you have brought these men to this court who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.

\s5
\v 38 Therefore, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have an accusation against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them accuse one another.
\v 39 But if you seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.
\v 40 For indeed we are in danger of being accused  concerning this day’s riot. There is no cause for this disorder, and we will not be able to explain it."
\v 41 When he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.





\s5
\c 20
\p
\v 1 After the uproar was over, Paul sent for the disciples and encouraged them. Then he said farewell to them and left to go into Macedonia. 
\v 2 When he had gone through those regions and had encouraged the believers very much, he went into Greece. 
\v 3 After he had spent three months there, a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to sail for Syria, so he decided to return through Macedonia.

\s5
\v 4 Accompanying him as far as Asia were Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus; Aristarchus and Secundus, both from the Thessalonian believers; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia.
\v 5 But these men had gone before us and were waiting for us at Troas.
\v 6 We sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and in five days we came to them in Troas. There we stayed for seven days.

\s5
\p
\v 7 On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul spoke to the believers. He was planning to leave the next days, so he kept speaking until midnight.  
\v 8 There were many lamps in the upper room  where we had come together.

\s5
\v 9 In the window was sitting a young man named Eutychus, who fell into a deep sleep. As  Paul spoke even longer, this young man, still sleeping, fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.
\v 10 But Paul went down, stretched himself out on him, and embraced him. Then he said, " Do not be upset any more, for he is alive."

\s5
\v 11 Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking with them much longer until dawn, he left.
\v 12 They brought back the boy alive and were very much comforted. 

\s5
\p
\v 13 We ourselves went ahead of Paul by ship and sailed away to Assos, where we planned to take Paul on board. This is what he himself desired to do, because he planned to go by land.
\v 14 When he met us at Assos, we took him onto the ship and went to Mitylene.

\s5
\v 15 Then we sailed from there and arrived the next day opposite the island of Chios. The following day we touched at the island of Samos, and the day after we came to the city of Miletus.
\v 16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he would not spend any time in Asia; for he was hurrying  to be in Jerusalem for the day of Pentecost, if it were at all possible for him to do so.

\s5
\p
\v 17 From Miletus he sent men to Ephesus and called to himself the elders of the church.
\v 18 When they had come to him, he said to them,
\p "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I always spent my time with you.
\v 19 I kept serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind and with tears, and in sufferings that happened to me because of the plots of the Jews.
\v 20 You know how I did not keep back from declaring to you anything that was useful, and how I taught you in public and also going from house to house. 
\v 21 You know how I kept warning both Jews and to Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.

\s5
\v 22 And now, look, I go bound in the Holy Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there,
\v 23 except that the Holy Spirit witnesses to me in every city and says that chains and sufferings await me. 
\v 24 But I do not consider that my life is in any way precious to myself, so that I may finish my race and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to bear witness to the gospel of the grace of God.

\s5
\v 25 And now, look, I know that you all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will see my face no more.
\v 26 Therefore I testify to you this day, that I am innocent of the blood of any man.
\v 27 For I did not keep back from declaring to you the whole will of God.

\s5
\v 28 Therefore be careful about yourselves, and about all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, so that you shepherd the assembly of the Lord which he purchased with his own blood.
\v 29 I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, and not spare the flock.
\v 30 I know that from even among your own selves some men shall come and say corrupt things, in order to draw away the disciples after them. 


\s5
\v 31 So be on guard. Remember that for three years I did not stop instructing every one of you with tears night and day.

\v 32 And now I entrust you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all the ones who are set apart.

\s5
\v 33 I coveted no man’s silver, gold, or clothing.
\v 34 You yourselves know that these hands served my own needs and the needs of those who were with me. 
\v 35 In all things I gave you an example of how you should help the weak by working, and of how you should remember the words of the Lord Jesus, words that he himself said: "It is more blessed to give than to receive."

\s5
\p
\v 36 After he had spoken in this way, he knelt  down and prayed with them all.
\v 37 They all cried very much and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him.
\v 38 They were sad most of all because of what he had said, that they would never see his face again. Then they escorted him to the ship. 






\s5
\c 21
\p
\v 1 When we had parted from them and had set sail, we took a straight course to the city of Cos, and the next day to the city of Rhodes, and from there to the city of Patara.
\v 2 When we found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.

\s5
\v 3 When we had come in sight of the island of Cyprus, we left it on the left, and sailed to Syria, and landed at the city of Tyre, because it was there that the ship was to unload its cargo. 
\v 4 After we found the disciples, we stayed there seven days. These disciples said to Paul through the Spirit that he should not set foot in Jerusalem.

\s5
\v 5 When we had spent the days, we left and went on our journey. They all, with their wives and children, escorted us on our way until we were out of the city. Then we knelt down on the beach, prayed, and said farewell to each other.  
\v 6 We went on board the ship, while they returned home again.

\s5
\p
\v 7 When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. There we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for one day.
\v 8 On the next day we left and went to Caesarea. We entered the house of Philip,  preacher of the gospel, who was one of the seven, and we stayed with him.
\v 9 Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.

\s5
\v 10 As we stayed there for some days, there came down from Judea a certain prophet named Agabus.
\v 11 He came to us and took Paul’s belt. With it he tied his own feet and hands and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, 'So shall the Jews in Jerusalem tie up the man who owns this belt, and they will hand him over into the hands of the Gentiles.'"

\s5
\v 12 When we heard these things, both we and the people who lived in that place begged Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
\v 13 Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready, not only to be tied up, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
\v 14 Since Paul did not wish to be persuaded, we stopped trying and said, "May the will of the Lord be done."

\s5
\p
\v 15 After these days, we picked up our bags and went up to Jerusalem.
\v 16 There also went with us some of the  disciples from Caesarea. They brought with them a man named Mnason, a man from Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we would stay.

\s5
\p
\v 17 When we had arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly.
\v 18 The next day Paul went with us to James,  and all the elders were present.
\v 19 When he had greeted them, he reported one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.

\s5
\v 20 When they heard it, they praised God,  and they said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands have believed among the Jews. They are all determined to keep the law.
\v 21 They have been told about you, that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to abandon Moses, and that you tell them not to circumcise their children, and not to follow the old customs.

\s5
\v 22 What should we do? They will certainly hear that you have come.
\v 23 So do what we say to you now: we have four men who made a vow.
\v 24 Take these men and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, so that they may shave their heads. So everyone will know that the things they have been told about you are false. They will learn that you also live so as to keep the law. 
\s5
\v 25 But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote and gave the instructions that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality."
\v 26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them went into the temple, announcing the period of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.

\s5
\p
\v 27 When the seven days were almost finished, some Jews from Asia saw Paul in the temple, and excited all the multitude, and laid hands on him.
\v 28 They were shouting, "Men of Israel, help us. This is the man who teaches all men everywhere things that are against the people, the law, and this place. Besides, he has also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place."
\v 29 For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they thought that Paul had brought him into the temple.

\s5
\v 30 All the city was excited, and the people ran together and laid hold of Paul. They dragged him out of the temple, and  the doors were immediately shut. 
\v 31 As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the chief captain of the guard that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.

\s5
\v 32 Right away he took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the crowd. When the people saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
\v 33 Then the chief captain approached and laid hold on Paul, and commanded him to be bound with two chains.  He asked who he was and what he had done.

\s5
\v 34 Some in the crowd were shouting one thing and others another. Since the captain could not tell anything because of all the noise, he ordered that Paul be brought into the fortress. 

\v 35 When he came to the steps, he was carried by the soldiers because of the crowd's violence.
\v 36 For the crowd of people followed after and kept shouting out, "Away with him!"

\s5
\p
\v 37 As Paul was about to be brought into the fortress, he said to the chief captain, "May I say something to you?" The captain said, "Do you speak Greek?
\v 38 Are you not then the Egyptian, who previously led a rebellion and took the four thousand terrorists into the wilderness?"


\s5
\v 39 Paul said, "I am a Jew, from the city of Tarsus in Cilicia. I am a citizen of an important city. I ask you, allow me to speak to the people."

\v 40 When the captain had given him permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned with the hand to the people. When there was was a deep silence, he spoke to them in Hebrew. He said,





\s5
\c 22
\p
\v 1  "Brothers and fathers, listen to my defense which I will now make to you."
\p
\v 2 When the crowd heard Paul speak to them in the Hebrew language, they became quiet. He said, 

\s5
\p
\v 3 "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but educated in this city at the feet of Gamaliel. I was instructed according to the strict ways of the law of our forefathers. I am zealous for God, just as all of you are today.
\v 4 I persecuted this Way to the death; I tied up both men and women and delivered them into prison.
\v 5 Also the high priest and all the elders can bear witness that I received letters from them for the brothers in Damascus, for me to journey there.   I was to bring back  in bonds to Jerusalem those of this Way to be punished.

\s5
\v 6 It happened that when I was traveling and nearing Damascus, about noon suddenly a great light from heaven  began to shine around me.
\v 7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'
\v 8 I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' He said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.'

\s5
\v 9 Those who were with me saw the light, but they did not hear the voice of him who spoke to me.
\v 10 I said, 'What should I do, Lord?' The Lord said to me, 'Arise and go into Damascus; there  you will be told everything that you must do.'
\v 11 I could not see because of that light's brightness, so I went into Damascus being led by the hands of those who were with me.

\s5
\v 12 There I met a man named Ananias, a devout man according to the law and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there.
\v 13  He came to me, stood by me, and said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight.'  In that very hour I saw him.

\s5
\v 14 Then he said, 'The God of our forefathers has chosen you to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear the voice coming from his own mouth.
\v 15 For you shall be a witness for him to all men about what you have seen and heard.
\v 16 And now why are you waiting? Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.'

\s5
\v 17 After I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple, it happened that I fell into a trance.
\v 18 I saw him say to me, 'Hurry and leave Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'

\s5
\v 19 I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you in every synagogue.
\v 20 When the blood of Stephen your witness was spilled, I also was standing by and agreeing, and I was guarding the clothings of those who killed him.'
\v 21 But he said to me, 'Leave, because I will send you away to the Gentiles.'"

\s5
\p
\v 22 The people allowed him to speak up to this point. But then they shouted and said, "Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not right that he should live."
\v 23 As they were shouting, throwing off their garments, and throwing dust into the air,
\v 24 the chief captain commanded Paul to be brought into the fortress. He ordered that he should be  questioned with scourging, so  that he himself might know why they were shouting against him like that.

\s5
\v 25 When they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?"
\v 26 When the centurion heard this, he went to the chief captain and told him, saying, "What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen."

\s5
\v 27 The chief captain came and said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" Paul said, "Yes."
\v 28 The chief captain answered, "It was only with a large amount of money that I acquired citizenship." But Paul said, "I was born a Roman citizen."
\v 29 Then the men who were going to question him left him immediately. The chief captain also was afraid, when he learned that Paul was a Roman citizen, because he had tied him up.

\s5
\p
\v 30 On the next day, the chief captain wanted to know the truth about the Jews' accusations against Paul. So he untied his bonds and ordered the chief priests and all the council to meet. Then he brought Paul down and placed him in their midst.





\s5
\c 23
\p
\v 1 Paul looked directly at the council members and said, "Brothers, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day."
\v 2 The high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
\v 3 Then said Paul to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall. Are you sitting to judge me by the law, yet order me to be struck, against the law?"

\s5
\v 4 Those who stood by said, "Is this how you insult God’s high priest?"
\v 5 Paul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, 
\q You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people."

\s5
\v 6 When Paul saw that the one part of the council were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he spoke loudly in the council, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is because I confidently expect the resurrection of the dead that I am being judged."
\v 7 When he said this, an argument began  between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
\v 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, no angels, and no spirits, but the Pharisees say that all of these exist.

\s5
\v 9 So a large uproar occurred, and some of the scribes belonging to the Pharisees stood up and argued, saying, "We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"
\v 10 When there arose a great argument, the chief captain feared that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, so he commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among the council members, and bring him into the fortress.

\s5
\p
\v 11 The following night the Lord stood beside him and said, " Do not be afraid, for as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome."

\s5
\p
\v 12 When it became day, some Jews made a pact and called a curse down upon themselves: they said that they would neither eat nor drink anything until they had killed Paul.
\v 13 There were more than forty men who made this plot.

\s5
\v 14 They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, "We have put ourselves under a great curse, to eat nothing until we have killed Paul.
\v 15 Now, therefore, let the council tell the chief captain to bring him down to you, as if  you would decide his case more precisely. As for us, we are ready to kill him before he comes here."


\s5
\v 16 But Paul’s sister’s son heard that they were lying in wait, so he went and entered the fortress and told Paul.
\v 17 Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the chief captain, for he has something to tell him."

\s5
\v 18 So the centurion took the young man and brought him to the chief captain and said, "Paul the prisoner called me to him, and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has  something to say to you."
\v 19 The chief captain took him by the hand to a private place and asked him, "What is it that you have to tell me?"

\s5
\v 20 The young man said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring down Paul tomorrow to the council, as if they were going to ask more precisely about his case. 
\v 21 But do not give in to them, because there are more than forty men who are lying in wait for him. They have called a curse down on themselves, neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him. Even now they are ready, waiting for consent from you."

\s5
\v 22 So the chief captain let the young man go, after instructing him,  "Tell no one that you have said these things to me."
\v 23 Then he called to him two of the centurions and said, "Get two hundred soldiers ready to go as far as Caesarea, and seventy  horsemen also, and two hundred spearmen. You will leave at the third hour of the night."
\v 24 He also ordered them to provide animals which Paul could ride, and to take him safely to Felix the governor. 

\s5
\v 25 Then he wrote a letter like this:
\p
\v 26 "Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.
\v 27 This man was arrested by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, when I came upon them with soldiers and rescued him, since I learned that he was a Roman citizen.

\s5
\v 28 I wanted to know why they accused him, so I took him down to their council.
\v 29 I learned that he was being accused about questions concerning their own law, but that  there was no accusation against him that deserved death or imprisonment.
\v 30 Then it was made known to me that there was  a plot against the man, so I immediately sent him to you, and instructed his accusers also to bring their charges against him in your presence. Farewell."

\s5
\p
\v 31 So the soldiers obeyed their orders: they  took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
\v 32 On the next day, most of the soldiers left the horsemen to go with him and they themselves returned to the fortress.
\v 33 When the horsemen reached Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.

\s5
\v 34 When the governor read the letter, he asked what province Paul was from; when he learned that he was from Cilicia,
\v 35 he said, "I will hear you fully when your accusers come here." Then he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s palace.





\s5
\c 24
\p
\v 1 After five days, Ananias the chief priest, certain elders, and an orator named Tertullus, went there. These men brought charges against Paul to the governor.
\v 2 When Paul stood before the governor, Tertullus began to accuse him and said to the governor, “Because of you we have great peace; and your foresight brings good reform to our nation;
\p 
\v 3 so  with all thankfulness we welcome everything that you do, most excellent Felix.

\s5
\v 4 So that I detain you no more, I ask you to briefly listen to me with kindness.
\v 5 For we have found this man to be a pest and one who causes all the Jews throughout the world to rebel. He is a leader of the Nazarene sect.
\v 6 \f + \ft Acts 24:6-8, the best ancient copies omit the words "all of" from verse 6 as well as the additions to 24:7 and 8 (see footnotes).\f* He even tried to desecrate the temple; so we arrested him. 


\s5
\v 7 \f + \ft The best ancient copies omit vs 7, \fqa "And we wanted to judge him according to our law," \f*
\v 8 \f + \ft The best ancient copies omit the addition to vs 8, \fqa "ordering those who accused him to come before you."\f* When you question Paul about all these matters, you, too, will be able to learn what we accuse him of."
\v 9 The Jews together accused Paul, too, and said that these things were true.

\s5
\p
\v 10 But when the governor motioned for Paul to speak, Paul answered, “I understand that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, and so I gladly explain myself to you.
\p 
\v 11 You are able to verify that it has been not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem;
\v 12 and when they found me in the temple, I did not argue with anyone, and I did not stir up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or either in the city;
\v 13 and they cannot prove to you the accusations that they make against me now.

\s5
\v 14 But I admit this to you, that according to the way that they call a sect, in that same way I serve the God of our forefathers. I am faithful to all that is in the law and the writings of the prophets.
\v 15 I have the same confidence in God, just as these men also wait for it, the coming resurrection of the dead, of both the righteous ones and the unrighteous ones;
\v 16 and in this, I work to have a conscience without blame before God and men through all things.

\s5
\v 17 Now after many years I came to bring help to my nation and gifts of money.
\v 18 When I did this, certain Jews from Asia found me in a purification ceremony in the temple, not with a crowd or an uproar.
\v 19 These men ought to be before you now and say what they have against me, if they have anything.

\s5
\v 20 Or else, these same men should say what wrong they found in me when I stood before the Jewish Council;
\v 21 unless it is about this one thing that I said out loud when I stood among them: 'It is about the resurrection of the dead that I am being judged today by you'.”

\s5
\p
\v 22 Felix was well informed about the Way, and so he made the Jews wait. He said, "Whenever Lysias the commander comes down from Jerusalem I will decide your case.”
\v 23 Then he commanded the centurion to guard Paul, but to have leniency, and that no one should stop his friends from helping him or from visiting him.

\s5
\p
\v 24 After some days, Felix returned with Druscilla his wife, a Jewess, and he sent for Paul and he heard from him about faith in Christ Jesus.
\v 25 But when Paul reasoned with him about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became fearful; and, he answered, "Go away for the present, but when I have time again, I will call you."

\s5
\v 26 At the same time, he was hoping that Paul would give money to him, so he often sent for him and spoke with him. 
\v 27 But when two years passed, Porcius Festus became the governor after Felix, but Felix wanted to gain favor with the Jews, so he left Paul to continue under guard.





\s5
\c 25
\p
\v 1 Now, Festus entered the province, and after three days, he went from Caesarea up to Jerusalem.
\v 2 The chief priest and the prominent Jews brought accusations against Paul to Festus, and they spoke strongly to Festus.
\v 3 And they asked Festus for a favor concerning Paul, that he might call him to Jerusalem so that they could kill him along the way.

\s5
\v 4 But Festus answered that Paul was a prisoner in Caesarea, and that he himself was soon to return there.
\v 5 "Therefore, those who can,” he said, "should go there with us. If there is something wrong with the man, you should accuse him.”

\s5
\p
\v 6 After he stayed eight or ten more days, he went down to Caesarea. And on the next day, he sat in the judgment seat and commanded Paul to be brought to him.
\v 7 When he arrived, the Jews from Jerusalem stood nearby, and they brought many serious charges which they could not prove.
\v 8 Paul defended himself and said, “Not against the name of the Jews, not against the temple, and not against Caesar, have I done wrong.”

\s5
\v 9 But Festus wanted to gain the favor of the Jews, and so he answered Paul and said, "Do you want to go up to Jerusalem and to be judged by me about these things there?”
\v 10 Paul said, "I stand before the judgment seat of Caesar where I must be judged. I have wronged no Jews, just as you also very well know.

\s5
\v 11 Though if I have done wrong and if I have done what is worthy of death, I do not refuse to die. But if their accusations are nothing, no one may hand me over to them. I call upon Caesar."
\v 12 Then Festus talked with the council and then he answered, "You called upon Caesar; you will go to Caesar."

\s5
\p
\v 13 Now after some days, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay an official visit to Festus.
\v 14 After he had been there for many days, Festus presented Paul’s case to the king; he said, "A certain man was left behind here by Felix as a prisoner.
\v 15 When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against this man to me, and they asked for condemnation against him. 
\v 16 To this I answered that it is not the custom with Romans to give up a man as a favor; rather, the accused man should have an opportunity to face his accusers and to make a defense against the charges.”

\s5
\v 17 Therefore, when they came together here, I did not wait, but the next day I sat in the judgment seat and I ordered the man to be brought in.
\v 18 When the accusers stood up and accused him, I thought that none of the charges that they brought against him were serious.
\v 19 Instead, they had certain disputes with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus who was dead, whom Paul claims to be alive.
\v 20 I was puzzled about how to investigate this matter, and I asked him if he would go to Jerusalem to be judged there about these things.

\s5
\v 21 But when Paul called to be kept under guard for the Emperor’s decision, I ordered him to be kept until I send him to Caesar.”
\v 22 Agrippa spoke to Festus, "I would also like to listen to this man.” "Tomorrow," Festus said, “You will hear him."

\s5
\p
\v 23 So on the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came with much ceremony; they came into the hall with the military officers and with the prominent men of the city. And when Festus spoke the command, Paul was brought to them.
\v 24 Festus said, "King Agrippa, and all you men who are here with us, you see this man; all the multitude of Jews consulted with me in Jerusalem and here also, and they shouted to me that he should no longer live.

\s5
\v 25 But I learned that he had done nothing worthy of death; but because he called upon the Emperor, I decided to send him.
\v 26 But I do not have something logical to write to the Emperor. For this reason, I have brought him to you, especially to you, King Agrippa, so that I might have something to write about the case.
\v 27 For it seems unreasonable for me to send a prisoner and to not also state the charges against him.”





\s5
\c 26
\p
\v 1 So Agrippa said to Paul, "You may speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense.
\p
\v 2 "I regard myself as happy, King Agrippa, to make my case before you today against all the accusations of the Jews;
\v 3 especially, because you are an expert in all the Jewish customs and questions. So I ask you to hear me patiently.

\s5
\v 4 Truly, all the Jews know how I lived from my youth in my own nation and at Jerusalem.
\v 5 They knew me from the beginning and they should admit that I lived as a Pharisee, a very strict sect of our religion.

\s5
\v 6 Now I stand here to be judged because I look for the promise that God made to our fathers.
\v 7 For this reason our twelve tribes earnestly serve God night and day, and we hope to reach it. It is for this hope the Jews accuse me, King!
\v 8 Why do you think it to be incredible for God to raise the dead?

\s5
\v 9 At one time I thought to myself that I should do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
\v 10 I did these in Jerusalem; I locked up many of the saints in prison, and I had authority from the chief priests to do this; and when they were killed, I gave my vote against them also.
\v 11 I punished them often in all the synagogues and I tried to make them blaspheme. I was very angry at them and I chased them even to foreign cities.

\s5
\v 12 While I was doing this, I went to Damascus with authority and orders from the chief priests;
\v 13 and on the way there, at midday, King, I saw a light from heaven that was brighter than the sun and it shone around both me and the men who were traveling with me.
\v 14 When we all fell to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me that said in the Hebrew language, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick a goad.

\s5
\v 15 Then I said, 'Who are you, Lord?' The Lord replied, 'I am Jesus whom you persecute.
\v 16 Now get up and stand on your feet; because for this purpose I appeared to you, to appoint you to be a servant and a witness concerning the things that you know about me now and the things that I will show to you later;
\v 17 and I will rescue you from the people and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you,
\v 18 to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive from God the forgiveness of sins and the inheritance that I give to them whom I set apart for myself by faith in me.'

\s5
\v 19 Therefore, king Agrippa, I did not disobey the heavenly vision;
\v 20 but, to those in Damascus first, and then at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, I preached that they should repent and turn to God, doing deeds worthy of repentance.
\v 21 For this cause the Jews arrested me in the temple and tried to kill me.

\s5
\v 22 God has helped me until now, so I stand and testify to the common people and to the great ones about nothing more than what the prophets and Moses said would happen;
\v 23 that Christ must suffer, and that he would be the first to be raised from the dead and to proclaim light to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.

\s5
\p
\v 24 As Paul completed his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, you are insane; your great learning makes you insane."
\v 25 But Paul said, "I am not insane, most excellent Festus; but with courage I speak words of truth and soberness.
\v 26 For the king knows about these things; and so, I speak freely to him, for I am persuaded that none of this is hidden from him; for this has not been done in a corner.
\s5
\v 27 Do you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you believe."
\v 28 Agrippa said to Paul, "In a short time would you persuade me and make me a Christian?"
\v 29 Paul said, "I pray to God, that whether in a short or long time, not you only, but also all that hear me today, would be like me, but without these prison chains."

\s5
\p
\v 30 Then the king stood up, and the governor, and Bernice also, and those who were sitting with them;
\v 31 when they left the hall, they talked to one another and said, "This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
\v 32 Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could  have been freed if he had not appealed to Caesar."





\s5
\c 27
\p
\v 1 When it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they handed over Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan Regiment.
\v 2 We boarded a ship from Adramyttium, which was about to sail along the coast of Asia. So we went to sea. Aristarchus from Thessalonica in Macedonia went with us.

\s5
\v 3 The next day we landed at the city of Sidon, where Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to receive their care.
\v 4 From there, we went to sea and sailed around the island of Cyprus that was sheltered from the wind, because the wind was against us. 
\v 5 When we had sailed across the water that is near Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
\v 6 There, the centurion found a ship from Alexandria that was going to sail to Italy. He put us in it.

\s5
\v 7 When we had sailed slowly for many days and had finally arrived with difficulty near  Cnidus, the wind no longer allowed us to go that way, so we sailed along the sheltered side of Crete, opposite Salmone.
\v 8 We sailed along the coast with difficulty, until  we came to a certain place called Fair Havens which is near the city of Lasea.

\s5
\p
\v 9 We had now taken much time, the time of the Jewish fast also had passed, and it had now become dangerous to sail. So Paul warned them,
\v 10 and said, "Men, I see that the voyage we are about to take will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
\v 11 But the centurion paid more attention to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things that were spoken by Paul.

\s5
\v 12 Because the harbor was not easy to spend the winter in, most of the sailors advised to sail from there, if by any means we could reach the city of Phoenix, to spend the winter there.  Phoenix is a harbor in Crete, and it faces northeast and southeast.
\v 13 When the south wind began to blow gently, the sailors thought that they had what they needed. So they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the shore.

\s5
\v 14 But after a short time a tempestuous wind, called The Northeaster, began to beat down on us from across the island.
\v 15 When the ship was caught head on and could not face the wind, we gave in to it and were driven along by it.
\v 16 We ran along the sheltered side of a small island called Cauda; and with difficulty we were able to secure the lifeboat.
    
\s5
\v 17 When they had hoisted it up, they used its ropes to bind the hull of the ship. They were afraid that we should run upon the sandbars of Syrtis, so they let down the sea anchor and were driven along.
\v 18 We were very battered by the storm, so the next day the sailors began to throw the cargo overboard.
    
\s5
\v 19 On the third day the sailors threw overboard the ship's tackle with their own hands.
\v 20 When the sun and stars did not shine on us for many days, and the great storm still beat upon us, any more hope that we should be saved was abandoned.

\s5
\v 21 When they had gone long without food, then Paul stood up among the sailors and said, "Men, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, so as to get this injury and loss.
\v 22 And now I encourage you to take courage, for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only the loss of the ship.

\s5
\v 23 For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong, whom also I worship—his angel stood beside me 
\v 24 and said, "Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar, and see, God in his kindness has given to you all those who are sailing with you.
\v 25 Therefore, men, take courage, for I trust God, that it will happen just as it was told me.
\v 26 But we must wreck upon some island."

\s5
\p
\v 27 When the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven this way and that in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors thought that they were approaching some land.
\v 28 They took soundings and found twenty fathoms; after a little while, they took more soundings and found fifteen fathoms.
\v 29 They were afraid that we might crash on the rocks, so they lowered four anchors from the stern and prayed that morning would come soon.

\s5
\v 30 The sailors were looking for a way to abandon the ship and had lowered the lifeboat into the sea, and pretended that they would throw down the anchors from the bow.
\v 31 But Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."
\v 32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and let it drift away.

\s5
\v 33 When daylight was coming on, Paul urged them all to take some food. He said, "This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and do not eat; you have eaten nothing.
\v 34 So I beg you to take some food, for this is for your survival; and not one  hair of your head will be lost."
\v 35 When he had said this, he took bread and he thanked God in the sight of everyone. Then he broke the bread and began to eat.

\s5
\v 36 Then they were all encouraged and they also took food.
\v 37 We were 276 people in the ship.
\v 38 When they had eaten enough, they made the ship lighter by throwing out the wheat into the sea.

\s5
\v 39 When it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a beach, and they discussed whether they could drive the ship onto it.
\v 40 So they cut loose the anchors and left them in the sea.  At the same time they loosed the ropes of the rudders and raised the foresail to the wind; and so they headed to the beach.
\v 41 But they came to a place where two currents met, and the ship ran into the ground. The bow of the ship stuck there and remained unmoveable, but the stern began to break up because of the waves' violence.

\s5
\v 42 The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners so that none of them could swim away and escape.
\v 43 But the centurion wanted to save Paul, so he stopped their plan; and he ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.
\v 44 Then the rest of the men should follow, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. In this way it happened that all of us came safely to land.





\s5
\c 28
\p
\v 1 When we were brought safely through, we learned that the island was called Malta.
\v 2 The native people offered to us not just ordinary kindness, but they lit a fire and welcomed us all, because of the constant rain and cold.

\s5
\v 3 But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and placed them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened onto his hand.
\v 4 When the native people saw the animal hanging from his hand, they said one to another, "This man certainly is a murderer who escaped from the sea, yet justice does not permit him to live."


\s5
\v 5 But then he shook the animal into the fire and suffered no harm.
\v 6 They were waiting for him to become inflamed with a fever or to suddenly drop dead. But after they watched him for a long time  and saw that nothing was unusual with him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.

\s5
\p
\v 7 Now in a nearby place there were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, a man named Publius. He welcomed us and kindly provided for us for three days.
\v 8 It happened that the father of Publius had been made ill with a fever and dysentery. When Paul went to him, he prayed, placed his hands on him, and healed him.
\v 9 After this happened, the rest of the people on the island who were sick also came and were healed.
\v 10 The people also honored us with many honors. When we were preparing to sail, they gave us what we needed.


\s5
\p
\v 11 After three months, we set sail in an Alexandrian ship that had wintered at the island, whose figurehead was The Twin Brothers.
\v 12 After we landed at the city of Syracuse, we stayed there three days.

\s5
\v 13 From there we sailed and arrived at the city of Rhegium. After one day a south wind sprang up, and in two days we came to the city of Puteoli.
\v 14 There we found some brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. In this way we came to Rome.
\v 15 From there the brothers, after they heard about us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns. When Paul saw the brothers, he thanked God and took courage.

\s5
\p
\v 16 When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier who was guarding him.
\p
\v 17 Then it came about that after three days Paul called together those men who were the leaders among the Jews. When they had come together, he said to them, "Brothers, although I have done nothing wrong against the people or the customs of our forefathers, I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
\v 18 After they questioned me, they wished to set me free, because there was no reason in me for a death penalty. 

\s5
\v 19 But when the Jews spoke against their desire, I was forced to appeal to Caesar, although it is not as if I were bringing any accusation against my nation.
\v 20 Because of my appeal, then, I have asked to see you and to speak with you. It is because of what Israel is confident about that I am bound with this chain."

\s5
\v 21 Then they said to him, "We neither received letters from Judea about you, nor did any of the brothers come and report or say anything bad about you.
\v 22 But we want to hear from you what you think about this sect, because it is known by us that it is spoken against everywhere.

\s5
\p
\v 23 When they had set a day for him, more people came to him at his dwelling place. He presented the matter to them, and testified about the kingdom of God. He tried to persuade them about Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening.
\v 24 Some were convinced about the things which were said, while others did not believe.

\s5
\v 25 When they did not agree with one another, they left after Paul had spoken this one word, "The Holy Spirit spoke well through Isaiah the prophet to your forefathers.
\v 26 He said, 'Go to this people and say, 
\q 'By hearing you will hear, but not understand;
\q And seeing you will see, but will not perceive.

\s5
\q
\v 27 For the heart of this people has become dull,
\q Their ears have heard with difficulty,
\q They have shut their eyes;
\q Lest they might perceive with their eyes,
\q And hear with their ears,
\q And understand with their heart,
\q And turn again,
\q And I would heal them.'
\m

\s5
\v 28 Therefore, you should know that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen.
\v 29 \f + \ft Acts 28:29 - the best ancient copies omit vs. 29, \fqa When he had said these things, the Jew departed, having a great dispute among themselves. \f*
\s5
\p
\v 30 Paul lived for two whole years in his own rented house, and he welcomed all who came to him.
\v 31 He was preaching the kingdom of God and was teaching the things about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness. No one stopped him.
