\p
\v 1 The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel—now Reuben was Israel's firstborn, but his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel because Reuben had defiled his father's couch. So he is not recorded as being the oldest son.

\v 19 They attacked the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab.

\s5
\v 20 They received divine help against them. In this way, the Hagrites and all who were with them were defeated. This was because the Israelites cried out to God in the battle, and he responded to them, because they put their trust in him.
\v 21 They captured their animals, including fifty thousand camels, 250,000 sheep, two thousand donkeys, and 100,000 men.
\v 22 Because God fought for them, they killed many of the enemy. They lived in their land until the captivity.

\s5
\p
\v 23 The half tribe of Manasseh lived in the land of Bashan as far as Baal Hermon and Senir (that is, Mount Hermon).
\v 24 These were the leaders of their families: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel. They were strong and courageous men, famous men, leaders of their families.

\s5
\p
\v 25 But they were unfaithful to their ancestors' God. Instead, they worshiped the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them.
\v 26 The God of Israel stirred up Pul king of Assyria (also called Tilgath Pileser, king of Assyria). He took into exile the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh. He took brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and to the river of Gozan, where they remain to this day.

\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel. Every man of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell down dead on Mount Gilboa.
\v 2 The Philistines closely pursued Saul and his son. The Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, his sons.
\v 3 The battle went heavily against Saul, and the archers overtook him. He was in severe pain because of the archers.

\s5
\v 4 Then said Saul to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and thrust me through with it. Otherwise, these uncircumcised will come and abuse me." But his armor bearer would not, for he was very afraid. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.

\s5
\v 5 When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword and died.
\v 6 So Saul died, and his three sons, so all his household members died together.

\s5
\p
\v 7 When every man of Israel in the valley saw that they had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. Then the Philistines came and lived in them.
\v 8 It came about on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.

\s5
\v 9 They stripped him and took his head and his armor. They sent messengers throughout Philistia to carry the news to their idols and to the people.
\v 10 They put his armor in the temple of their gods, and fastened his head to the temple of Dagon.

\s5
\v 11 When all Jabesh Gilead heard of all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
\v 12 all the fighting men went and took away the body of Saul and those of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. They buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days.

\s5
\p
\v 13 So Saul died because he was unfaithful to Yahweh. He did not obey Yahweh's instructions, but asked for advice from someone who talked with the dead.
\v 14 He did not seek guidance from Yahweh, so Yahweh killed him and handed over the kingdom to David son of Jesse.

\s5
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Then all Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Look, we are your flesh and bone.
\v 2 In the recent past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led the Israelite army. Yahweh your God said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become a ruler over my people Israel.'"
\v 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them before Yahweh. They anointed David king over Israel. In this way, the word of Yahweh that had been declared by Samuel came true.

\s5
\p
\v 4 David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). Now the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.
\v 5 The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You will not come in here." But David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
\v 6 David had said, "Whoever attacks the Jebusites first will become a commander." So Joab son of Zeruiah attacked first, so he was made a commander.

\s5
\v 7 Then David began to live in the stronghold. So they called it the city of David.
\v 8 He fortified the city around from the Millo and back to the surrounding wall. Joab fortified the rest of the city.
\v 9 David became greater and greater because Yahweh of hosts was with him.

\s5
\p
\v 10 These were the leaders David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, obeying the word of Yahweh concerning Israel.
\v 11 This is a list of David's elite soldiers: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, was commander of the thirty. He killed three hundred men with his spear on one occasion.

\s5
\v 12 After him was Eleazar son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.
\v 13 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines assembled together for battle, where there was a barley field and the army fled from the Philistines.
\v 14 They stood in the middle of the field. They defended it and cut down the Philistines and Yahweh rescued them with a great victory.

\s5
\p
\v 15 And three of the thirty leaders went down to the rock to David, to the cave of Adullam. The army of the Philistines was camped in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 16 At that time David was in his stronghold, a cave, while the Philistines had established their camp at Bethlehem.
\v 17 David was longing for water and said, "If only someone would give me water to drink from the well at Bethlehem, the well that is by the gate!"

\s5
\v 18 So these three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, the well at the gate. They took the water and brought it to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to Yahweh.
\v 19 Then he said, "Far be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should drink this. Should I drink the blood of men who have risked their lives?" Because they had put their lives at risk, he refused to drink it. These are things the three mighty men did.

\s5
\p
\v 20 Abishai brother of Joab, was captain over the Three. He once used his spear against three hundred and killed them. He is mentioned along with the Three.
\v 21 Of the Three, he was given double honor and became their captain. Even though he was not one of them. 

\s5
\p
\v 22 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a strong man who did mighty feats. He killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down into a pit and killed a lion while it was snowing.
\v 23 He even killed an Egyptian, a man five cubits tall. The Egyptian had a spear like a weaver's beam, but he went down to him with only a staff. He seized the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.

\s5
\v 24 Benaiah son of Jehoiada did these feats, and he was named alongside the three mighty men.
\v 25 He was more highly regarded than the thirty soldiers in general, but he was not regarded quite as highly as the three most elite soldiers. Yet David put him in charge of his bodyguard.

\s5
\p
\v 26 The mighty men were Asahel brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
\v 27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
\v 28 Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abi Ezer the Anathothite,
\v 29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,

\s5
\v 30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite,
\v 31 Ittai son of Ribai of Gibeah of Benjamin's descendants, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
\v 32 Hurai of the valleys of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
\v 33 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,

\s5
\v 34 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite,
\v 35 Ahiam son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur,
\v 36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
\v 37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai son of Ezbai,

\s5
\v 38 Joel brother of Nathan, Mibhar son of Hagri,
\v 39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite (the armor bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah),
\v 40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
\v 41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai,

\s5
\v 42 Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite (a chief of the Reubenites) and thirty with him,
\v 43 Hanan son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,
\v 44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel sons of Hotham the Aroerite,

\s5
\v 45 Jediael son of Shimri, Joha (his brother the Tizite),
\v 46 Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite,
\v 47 Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.

\s5
\c 12
\p
\v 1 These were the men who came to David to Ziklag, while he was still banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish. They were among the soldiers, his helpers in battle.
\v 2 They were armed with bows and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow. They were Benjamites, Saul's fellow tribesmen.

\s5
\v 3 The chief was Ahi Ezer, then Joash, both sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite. There were Jeziel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth. There were also Beracah, Jehu the Anathothite,
\v 4 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a soldier among the thirty (and in command of the thirty); Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite,

\s5
\v 5 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite,
\v 6 the Korahites Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, Jashobeam, and
\v 7 Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham of Gedor.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Some Gadites joined David at the stronghold in the wilderness. They were fighting men, men trained for battle, who could handle shield and spear; whose faces were as fierce as the faces of lions. They were as swift as gazelles on the mountains.

\s5
\v 9 There were Ezer the leader, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
\v 10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
\v 11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
\v 12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
\v 13 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.

\s5
\v 14 These sons of Gad were leaders of the army. The least led a hundred, and the greatest led a thousand.
\v 15 They crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it overflowed its banks, and chased away all those living in the valleys, both toward the east and toward the west.

\s5
\p
\v 16 Some of the men of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David.
\v 17 David went out to meet them and addressed them: "If you have come in peace to me to help me, you may join me. But if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, may the God of our ancestors see and rebuke you, since I have done no wrong."

\s5
\v 18 Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty. Amasai said, "We are yours, David. We are on your side, son of Jesse. Peace, may peace be to whoever helps you. May peace be to your helpers, for your God is helping you." Then David received them and made them commanders over his men.

\s5
\p
\v 19 Some from Manasseh also deserted to David when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle. Yet they did not help the Philistines, because the Philistine lords consulted with each other and sent David away. They said, "He will desert to his master Saul at the risk of our lives."
\v 20 When he went to Ziklag, the men of Manasseh who joined him were Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains over thousands of Manasseh.

\s5
\v 21 They helped David fight against the roving bands, for they were fighting men. Later they became commanders in the army.
\v 22 Day after day, men came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like the army of God.

\s5
\p
\v 23 This is the record of the armed soldiers for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him, which carried out Yahweh's word.
\v 24 From Judah those who carried shield and spear were 6,800, armed for war.
\v 25 From the Simeonites there were 7,100 fighting men.

\s5
\v 26 From the Levites there were 4,600 fighting men.
\v 27 Jehoiada was the leader of Aaron's descendants, and with him were 3,700.
\v 28 With Zadok, a young, strong, and courageous man, were twenty-two leaders from his father's family.

\s5
\v 29 From Benjamin, Saul's tribe, were three thousand. Most of them had remained loyal to Saul until this time.
\v 30 From the Ephraimites there were 20,800 fighting men, men famous in their fathers' families.
\v 31 From the half tribe of Manasseh there were eighteen thousand famous men who came to make David king.

\s5
\v 32 From Issachar, there were two hundred leaders who had understanding of the times and knew what Israel ought to do. All their relatives were under their command.
\v 33 From Zebulun there were fifty thousand fighting men, prepared for battle, with all the weapons of war, and ready to give undivided loyalty.

\s5
\v 34 From Naphtali there were one thousand officers, and with them thirty-seven thousand men with shields and spears.
\v 35 From the Danites there were 28,600 men prepared for battle.

\s5
\v 36 From Asher there were forty thousand men prepared for battle.
\v 37 From the other side of the Jordan, from the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, there were 120,000 men armed with all kinds of weapons for battle.

\s5
\p
\v 38 All these soldiers, equipped for battle, came to Hebron with firm intentions to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of Israel were in agreement to make David king also.
\v 39 They were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their relatives had sent them with provisions.
\v 40 In addition, those who were near to them, as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen, and cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, wine, oil, oxen, and sheep, for Israel was celebrating.

\s5
\c 13
\p
\v 1 David consulted with the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with every leader.
\v 2 David said to all the assembly of Israel, "If it seems good to you, and if this comes from Yahweh our God, let us send messengers everywhere to our brothers who remain in all the regions of Israel, and to the priests and Levites who are in their cities. Let them be told to join us.
\v 3 Let us bring the ark of our God back to ourselves, for we did not seek his will in the days of Saul's reign."
\v 4 The whole assembly agreed to do these things, because they seemed right in the eyes of all the people.

\s5
\v 5 So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.
\v 6 David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, Kiriath Jearim, which belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by Yahweh's name, Yahweh, who sits enthroned over the cherubim.

\s5
\v 7 So they set the ark of God on a new cart. They brought it out of Abinadab's house. Uzza and Ahio were guiding the cart.
\v 8 David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might. They were singing with stringed instruments, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.

\s5
\p
\v 9 When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out with his hand to grab the ark, because the oxen stumbled.
\v 10 Then the anger of Yahweh burned against Uzzah, and Yahweh killed him because Uzzah had reached out with his hand to the ark. He died there before God.
\v 11 David was angry because Yahweh had attacked Uzzah. That place is called Perez Uzzah to this day.

\s5
\v 12 David was afraid of God that day. He said, "How can I bring the ark of God home to me?"
\v 13 So David did not move the ark to the city of David, but put it aside in the house of Obed Edom the Gittite.
\v 14 The ark of God remained in Obed Edom's household in his house for three months. So Yahweh blessed his house and all that he possessed.

\s5
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, carpenters, and masons. They built a house for him. 
\v 2 David knew that Yahweh had established him as king over Israel, and that his kingdom was exalted on high for the sake of his people Israel.

\s5
\p
\v 3 In Jerusalem, David took more wives, and he became the father of more sons and daughters.
\v 4 These were the names of the children who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
\v 5 Ibhar, Elishama, Elpelet,
\v 6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
\v 7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Now when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed as king over all Israel, they all went out looking for him. But David heard about it and went out against them.
\v 9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.

\s5
\v 10 Then David asked for help from God. He said, "Should I attack the Philistines? Will you give victory over them?" Yahweh said to him, "Attack, for I will certainly give them to you."
\v 11 So they came up to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He commented, "Yahweh has burst through my enemies by my hand like a bursting flood of water." So the name of that place became Baal Perazim.
\v 12 The Philistines abandoned their gods there, and David gave an order that they should be burned.

\s5
\p
\v 13 Then the Philistines raided the valley yet again.
\v 14 So David asked for help from God again. God said to him, "You must not attack their front, but rather circle around behind them and come on them through the balsam woods.

\s5
\v 15 When you hear the sound of marching in the wind blowing through the balsam treetops, then attack with force. Do this because God will have gone out before you to attack the army of the Philistines."
\v 16 So David did as God had commanded him. He defeated the army of the Philistines from Gibeon all the way to Gezer.
\v 17 Then David's fame went out into all lands, and Yahweh caused all nations to fear him.

\s5
\c 15
\p
\v 1 David built houses for himself in the city of David. He prepared a place for the ark of God and set up a tent for it.
\v 2 Then David said, "Only the Levites may carry the ark of God, for Yahweh has chosen them to carry it, and to serve him forever."
\v 3 Then David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh to the place he had prepared for it.

\s5
\v 4 David gathered together Aaron's descendants and the Levites.
\q
\v 5 From the descendants of Kohath, there was Uriel the leader and his relatives, 120 men.
\q
\v 6 From the descendants of Merari, there was Asaiah the leader and his relatives, 220 men.
\q

\s5
\v 7 From the descendants of Gershom, there was Joel the leader and his relatives, 130 men.
\q
\v 8 From the descendants of Elizaphan, there was Shemaiah the leader and his relatives, 200 men.
\q
\v 9 From the descendants of Hebron, there was Eliel the leader and his relatives, 80 men.
\q
\v 10 From the descendants of Uzziel, there was Amminadab the leader and his relatives, 112 men.

\s5
\v 11 David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
\v 12 He said to them, "You are the leaders of the Levite families. Dedicate yourselves to Yahweh, both you and your brothers, so that you may bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it.

\s5
\v 13 You did not carry it the first time. That is why Yahweh our God broke out against us, for we did not seek him or obey his decree."
\v 14 So the priests and the Levites dedicated themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 15 So the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded—following the rules given by the word of Yahweh.

\s5
\p
\v 16 David spoke to the leaders of the Levites to assign their brothers to be musicians with musical instruments, stringed instruments, harps and cymbals, playing loudly and joyfully lifting up their voices.
\v 17 So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel and one of his brothers, Asaph son of Berechiah. They also appointed kinsmen from Merari's descendants and Ethan son of Kushaiah.
\v 18 With them were their kinsmen of second rank: Zechariah, \f + \ft Some ancient copies add the name or prefix, "ben," assuming perhaps the name of Zechariah's father was omitted. \f* Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed Edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.

\s5
\v 19 The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were appointed to play loud bronze cymbals.
\v 20 Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah played the stringed instruments, set to Alamoth.
\v 21 Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah led the way with harps set to the Sheminith.

\s5
\v 22 Kenaniah, leader of the Levites, he was the director of the singing because he was a teacher of music.
\v 23 Berechiah and Elkanah were guards for the ark.
\v 24 Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed Edom and Jehiah were guards for the ark.

\s5
\p
\v 25 So David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Obed Edom's house with rejoicing.
\v 26 While God helped the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.

\s5
\v 27 David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were the Levites who carried the ark, the singers, and Kenaniah, the leader of the song with the singers. David was wearing a linen ephod.
\v 28 So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh with joyful shouting, and with the sound of horns, with cymbals, and with stringed instruments and harps.

\s5
\p
\v 29 But as the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David, Michal daughter of Saul, looked out the window. She saw King David dancing and celebrating. Then she despised him in her heart.

\s5
\c 16
\p
\v 1 They brought in the ark of God and put it in the middle of the tent that David had set up for it. Then they offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before God.
\v 2 When David had finished sacrificing the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh.
\v 3 He distributed to every Israelite, both to men and women, a loaf of bread, and a piece of meat, and a cake of raisins.

\s5
\p
\v 4 David appointed certain Levites to serve before the ark of Yahweh, and to celebrate, thank and praise Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 5 These Levites were Asaph the leader, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed Edom, and Jeiel. These were to play with stringed instruments and with harps. Asaph was to sound the cymbals, sounding loudly.
\v 6 Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow the horns regularly, before the ark of the covenant of God.

\s5
\p
\v 7 Then on that day David first appointed Asaph and his brothers to sing this song of thanksgiving to Yahweh.
\q
\v 8 Give thanks to Yahweh, call on his name;
\q make known his deeds among the nations.
\q
\v 9 Sing to him, sing praises to him;
\q speak of all his marvelous deeds.
\q

\s5
\v 10 Boast in his holy name;
\q let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.
\q
\v 11 Seek Yahweh and his strength;
\q seek his presence continually.
\q

\s5
\v 12 Recall the marvelous things he has done,
\q his miracles and the decrees from his mouth,
\q
\v 13 you descendants of Israel his servant,
\q you people of Jacob, his chosen ones.
\q
\v 14 He is Yahweh, our God.
\q His decrees are on all the earth.
\q

\s5
\v 15 Keep his covenant in mind forever,
\q the word that he commanded for a thousand generations.
\q
\v 16 He calls to mind the covenant that he made with Abraham,
\q and his oath to Isaac.
\q
\v 17 This is what he confirmed to Jacob as a statute,
\q and to Israel as an everlasting covenant.
\q
\v 18 He said, "I will give you the land of Canaan
\q as your share of your inheritance."
\q

\s5
\v 19 I said this when you were only few in number,
\q so very few, and were strangers in the land.
\q
\v 20 They went from nation to nation,
\q from one kingdom to another.
\q
\v 21 He did not allow anyone to oppress them;
\q he punished kings for their sakes.
\q
\v 22 he said, "Do not touch my anointed ones,
\q And do not harm my prophets."
\q

\s5
\v 23 Sing to Yahweh, all the earth;
\q announce his salvation day after day.
\q
\v 24 Declare his glory among the nations,
\q his marvelous deeds among all the nations.
\q

\s5
\v 25 For Yahweh is great and is to be praised greatly,
\q and he is to be feared above all other gods.
\q
\v 26 For all the gods of the nations are idols,
\q but it is Yahweh who made the heavens.
\q
\v 27 Splendor and majesty are in his presence.
\q Strength and joy are in his place.
\q

\s5
\v 28 Ascribe to Yahweh, you clans of peoples,
\q ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength;
\q
\v 29 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name.
\q Bring an offering and come before him.
\q Bow down to Yahweh in his holy splendor.
\q

\s5
\v 30 Tremble before him, all the earth.
\q The world also is established; it cannot be shaken.
\q
\v 31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
\q let them say among the nations, "Yahweh reigns."
\q

\s5
\v 32 Let the sea roar, and that which fills it shout with joy.
\q Let the fields be joyful, and all that is in them.
\q
\v 33 Then let the trees in the forest shout for joy before Yahweh,
\q for he is coming to judge the earth.
\q

\s5
\v 34 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,
\q for his covenant faithfulness endures forever.
\q
\v 35 And say, "Save us, God of our salvation.
\q Gather us together and rescue us from the other nations,
\q so that we may give thanks to your holy name
\q and glory in your praises."
\q

\s5
\v 36 May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be praised 
\q from everlasting to everlasting.
\m All the people said, "Amen" and praised Yahweh.

\s5
\p
\v 37 So David left Asaph and his brothers before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, to serve continually before the ark, as every day's work required.
\v 38 Obed Edom with those sixty-eight relatives were included. Obed Edom son of Jeduthun, along with Hosah, were to be gatekeepers.
\v 39 Zadok the priest and his fellow priests were to serve before the tabernacle of Yahweh at the high place in Gibeon.

\s5
\v 40 They were to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar for burnt offerings continually morning and evening, according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh, which he gave as a command to Israel.
\v 41 Heman and Jeduthun were with them, together with the rest who were chosen by name, to give thanks to Yahweh, because his covenant faithfulness endures forever.

\s5
\v 42 Heman and Jeduthun were in charge of those who played trumpets, cymbals, and the other instruments for the sacred music. The sons of Jeduthun guarded the gate.
\v 43 Then all the people returned to their homes, and David returned to bless his own household.

\s5
\c 17
\p
\v 1 It happened that after the king had settled in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet, "Look, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is staying under a tent."
\v 2 Then Nathan said to David, "Go, do what is in your heart, for God is with you."

\s5
\v 3 But that same night the word of God came to Nathan and said,
\v 4 "Go and tell David my servant, 'This is what Yahweh says: You will not build me a house in which to live.
\v 5 For I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up Israel to this present day. Instead, I have been living in a tent, a tabernacle, in various places.
\v 6 In all places I have moved among all Israel, did I ever say anything to any of Israel's leaders whom I appointed to shepherd my people, saying, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'"

\s5
\v 7 "Now then, tell my servant David, 'This is what Yahweh of hosts says: I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, so that you would be ruler over my people Israel.
\v 8 And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.

\s5
\v 9 I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them there, so that they may live in their own place and be troubled no more. No longer will wicked people oppress them, as they did before,
\v 10 as they were doing from the days that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that I, Yahweh, will build you a house.

\s5
\v 11 It will come about that when your days are fulfilled for you to go to your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, and for one of your own descendants, I will establish his kingdom.
\v 12 He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.

\s5
\v 13 I will be a father to him, and he will be my son. I will not take my covenant faithfulness away from him, as I took it from Saul, who ruled before you. 
\v 14 I will set him over my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.'"
\v 15 Nathan spoke to David and reported to him all these words, and he told him about the entire vision.

\s5
\p
\v 16 Then David the king went in and sat before Yahweh; he said, "Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my family, that you have brought me to this point?
\v 17 And this was a small thing in your sight, God. You have spoken of your servant's family for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations, Yahweh God.
\v 18 What more can I, David, say to you? You have honored your servant. You have given your servant special recognition.

\s5
\v 19 Yahweh, for your servant's sake, and to fulfill your own purpose, you have done this great thing to reveal all your great deeds.
\v 20 Yahweh, there is none like you, and there is no God besides you, just as we have always heard.
\v 21 And what nation on earth is like your people Israel, whom you, God, rescued from Egypt as a people for yourself, to make a name for yourself by great and awesome deeds? You drove out nations from before your people, whom you rescued from Egypt.

\s5
\v 22 You made Israel your own people forever, and you, Yahweh, became their God.
\v 23 So now, Yahweh, may the promise that you made concerning your servant and his family be established forever. Do as you have spoken.
\v 24 May your name be established forever and be great, so the people will say, 'Yahweh of hosts is the God of Israel,' while the house of me, David, your servant is established before you.

\s5
\v 25 For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. That is why I, your servant, have found courage to pray to you.
\v 26 Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have made this good promise to your servant:
\v 27 Now it has pleased you to bless your servant's house, that it may continue forever before you. You, Yahweh, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever."

\s5
\c 18
\p
\v 1 After this it came about that David attacked the Philistines and defeated them. He took Gath and its villages out of the Philistines' control.
\v 2 Then he defeated Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David and paid him tribute.

\s5
\p
\v 3 David then defeated Hadadezer, king of Zobah at Hamath, as Hadadezer was traveling to establish his rule by the Euphrates River.
\v 4 David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen. David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved enough of them for a hundred chariots.

\s5
\p
\v 5 When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand Aramean men.
\v 6 Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became servants to him and brought him tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.

\s5
\v 7 David took the golden shields that were on Hadadezer's servants and brought them to Jerusalem.
\v 8 From Tibhath and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much bronze. It was with this bronze that Solomon later made the bronze sea, the pillars, and the bronze equipment.

\s5
\p
\v 9 When Toi, king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
\v 10 Toi sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and to bless him, because David had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him, and because Hadadezer had waged war against Toi. Hadoram brought with himself objects of silver, gold, and bronze. 
\v 11 King David dedicated these objects to Yahweh, together with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations: Edom, Moab, the people of Ammon, the Philistines, and Amalek.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Abishai son of Zeruiah killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the valley of Salt.
\v 13 He placed garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David's servants. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.

\s5
\p
\v 14 David reigned over all Israel, and he administered justice and righteousness to all his people.
\v 15 Joab son of Zeruiah was the commander of the army, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder.
\v 16 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests, and Shavsha was scribe.
\v 17 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites, and David's sons were the king's leading advisors.

\s5
\c 19
\p
\v 1 It came about later that Nahash, king of the people of Ammon, died, and that his son became king in his place.
\v 2 David said, "I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. David's servants entered the land of the Ammonites and went to Hanun, in order to console him. 
\v 3 But the Ammonites princes said to Hanun, "Do you think that David is honoring your father because he has sent men to comfort you? Do not his servants come to you to explore and examine the land in order to overthrow it?"

\s5
\v 4 So Hanun seized David's servants, shaved them, cut off their garments to the waist, up to their buttocks, and sent them away.
\v 5 When they explained this to David, he sent to meet with them, for the men were deeply ashamed. The king said, "Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return."

\s5
\p
\v 6 When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire Aramean chariots and horsemen from Naharaim, Maacah, and Zobah.
\v 7 They hired them thirty-two thousand chariots with the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. The Ammonites gathered themselves together from their cities, and came out for war.

\s5
\v 8 When David heard of it, he sent Joab and his entire army to meet them.
\v 9 The people of Ammon came out and lined up for battle at the city gate, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.

\s5
\p
\v 10 When Joab saw the battle lines facing him both in front and behind, he chose some of Israel's best fighters and arranged them against the Arameans.
\v 11 As for the rest of the army, he gave it into the command of Abishai his brother, and he put them into battle lines against the army of Ammon.

\s5
\v 12 Joab said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you, Abishai, must rescue me. But if the army of Ammon is too strong for you, then I will come and rescue you.
\v 13 Be strong, and let us show ourselves to be strong for our people and for the cities of our God, for Yahweh will do what is good for his purpose."

\s5
\v 14 So Joab and the soldiers of his army advanced to the battle against the Arameans, who were forced to flee before the army of Israel.
\v 15 When the army of Ammon saw that the Arameans had fled, they also fled from Joab's brother Abishai and went back into the city. Then Joab returned from the people of Ammon and went back to Jerusalem.

\s5
\p
\v 16 And when the Arameans saw that they were being defeated by Israel, they sent for reinforcements from beyond the Euphrates River, with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer's army.
\v 17 When David was told this, he gathered all Israel together, crossed the Jordan, and came upon them. He arranged the army for battle  against the Arameans, and they fought him.

\s5
\v 18 The Arameans fled from Israel, and David killed seven thousand Aramean charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach, the commander of the army.
\v 19 When all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and served them. So the people of Aram were no longer willing to help the Ammonites.

\s5
\c 20
\p
\v 1 It came about in the springtime, at the time when kings normally go to war, that Joab led the army into battle and devastated the land of the Ammonites. He went and besieged Rabbah. David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and defeated it.

\s5
\v 2 David took the crown of their king from off his head, and he found that it weighed a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones. The crown was set on David's head, and he brought out the plunder of the city in large quantities.
\v 3 He brought out the people who were in the city and forced them to work with saws and iron picks and axes. David required all the cities of the people of Ammon to do this labor. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem.

\s5
\p
\v 4 It came about after this that there was a battle at Gezer with the Philistines. Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were subdued.
\v 5 It came about again in a battle with the Philistines at Gob, that Elhanan son of Jari the Bethlehemite killed Lahmi brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.

\s5
\v 6 It came about in another battle at Gath that there was a man of great height who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. He also was descended from the Rephaim.
\v 7 When he mocked the army of Israel, Jehonadab son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him.
\v 8 These were descendants of the Rephaim of Gath, and they were killed by the hand of David and by the hand of his soldiers.

\s5
\c 21
\p
\v 1 An adversary arose against Israel and incited David to count Israel.
\v 2 David said to Joab and to the commanders of the army, "Go, count the people of Israel from Beersheba to Dan and report back to me, that I may know their number."
\v 3 Joab said, "May Yahweh make his army a hundred times greater than it is. But my master the king, do they not all serve my master? Why does my master want this? Why bring guilt on Israel?"

\s5
\v 4 But the king's word was final against Joab. So Joab left and went throughout all Israel. Then he came back to Jerusalem.
\v 5 Then Joab reported the total of the count of the fighting men to David. There were in Israel 1,100,000 men who drew the sword. Judah alone had 470,000 soldiers.

\s5
\v 6 But Levi and Benjamin were not counted among them, for the king's command had disgusted Joab.
\v 7 God was offended by this action, so he attacked Israel.
\v 8 David said to God, "I have greatly sinned by doing this. Now take away your servant's guilt, for I have acted very foolishly."

\s5
\p
\v 9 Yahweh told Gad, David's prophet,
\v 10 "Go say to David, 'This is what Yahweh says: I am giving you three choices. Choose one of them.'"

\s5
\v 11 So Gad went to David and said to him, "Yahweh says this, 'Choose one of these:
\v 12 either three years of famine, three months being pursued by your enemies and being caught by their swords, or else three days of Yahweh's sword, that is, a plague in the land, with the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the land of Israel.' Now then, decide what answer I should take to the one who sent me."

\s5
\v 13 Then David said to Gad, "I am in deep trouble. Let me fall into Yahweh's hands rather than into the hands of people, for his merciful actions are very great."
\v 14 So Yahweh sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand people died.
\v 15 God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy it, Yahweh watched and changed his mind about the harm. He said to the destroying angel, "Enough! Now draw back your hand." At that time the angel of Yahweh was standing at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

\s5
\v 16 David looked up and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand raised over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, lay facedown on the ground.
\v 17 David said to God, "Is it not I that commanded that the army be numbered? I did this wicked thing. But these sheep, what have they done? Yahweh my God! Let your hand strike me and my family, but do not let the plague remain on your people."

\s5
\p
\v 18 So the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up and build an altar for Yahweh at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\v 19 So David went up as Gad instructed him to do in the name of Yahweh.
\v 20 While Ornan was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel. He and his four sons with him hid themselves.

\s5
\v 21 When David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David. He left the threshing floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground.
\v 22 Then David said to Ornan, "Sell me this threshing floor, so I can build an altar for Yahweh. I will pay the full price, so that the plague may be removed from the people."

\s5
\v 23 Ornan said to David, "Take it as your own, my master the king. Do with it what is good in your sight. Look, I will give you oxen for burnt offerings, threshing sledges for wood, and wheat for the grain offering; I will give it all to you."
\v 24 King David said to Ornan, "No, I insist on buying it for the full price. I will not take what is yours and offer it as a burnt offering to Yahweh if it costs me nothing."

\s5
\v 25 So David paid six hundred shekels of gold for the place.
\v 26 David built an altar for Yahweh there and offered on it burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on Yahweh, who answered him with fire from heaven on the altar for burnt offerings.
\v 27 Then Yahweh gave an order to the angel, and the angel put his sword back into its sheath.

\s5
\p
\v 28 When David saw that Yahweh had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he performed the sacrifice there at that same time.
\v 29 Now at that time, Yahweh's tabernacle, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar for burnt offerings, were at the high place at Gibeon.
\v 30 However, David could not go there to ask for God's direction, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.

\s5
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Then David said, "This is where the house of Yahweh God will be, with the altar for the burnt offerings of Israel."
\p
\v 2 So David ordered his servants to gather together the foreigners living in the land of Israel. He assigned them to be stonecutters, to cut stone blocks, in order to build God's house.

\s5
\v 3 David supplied a large amount of iron for the nails for the doors to go in the gateways, and for braces. He also supplied more bronze than could be weighed,
\v 4 and more cedar trees than could be counted. (The Sidonians and the Tyrians brought too many cedar logs to David to count.)
\v 5 David said, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be especially magnificent, so that it will be famous and glorious in all other lands. So I will prepare for its building." So David made extensive preparations before his death.

\s5
\p
\v 6 Then he called for Solomon his son and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 7 David said to Solomon, "My son, it was my intention to build a house myself, for the name of Yahweh my God.
\v 8 But Yahweh came to me and said, 'You have shed much blood and have fought many battles. You will not build a house for my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.

\s5
\v 9 However, you will have a son who will be a peaceful man. I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. For his name will be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days.
\v 10 He will build a house for my name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.'

\s5
\v 11 Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you and enable you to succeed. May you build the house of Yahweh your God, as he said you would.
\v 12 Only may Yahweh give you insight and understanding, so that you may obey the law of Yahweh your God, when he places you in charge over Israel.
\v 13 Then you will succeed, if you carefully obey the statutes and the decrees that Yahweh gave to Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be discouraged.

\s5
\v 14 Now, see, at great effort I have prepared for Yahweh's house 100,000 talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron in large quantities. I have also provided timber and stone. You must add more to all this.

\s5
\v 15 You have many workmen with you: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and skillful craftsmen without number of every kind,
\v 16 who can work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron. So begin to work, and may Yahweh be with you."

\s5
\p
\v 17 David also ordered all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
\v 18 "Yahweh your God is with you and has given you peace on every side. He has handed over to me the region's inhabitants. The region is subdued before Yahweh and his people.
\v 19 Now seek Yahweh your God with all your heart and your soul. Get up and build the holy place of Yahweh God. Then you can bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and the things that belong to God into the house built for Yahweh's name."

\s5
\c 23
\p
\v 1 When David was old and near the end of his life, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
\v 2 He gathered together all the leaders of Israel, with the priests and Levites.
\v 3 The Levites who were thirty years old and older were counted. They numbered thirty-eight thousand.

\s5
\v 4 "Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of Yahweh's house, and six thousand were officers and judges.
\v 5 Four thousand were gatekeepers, and four thousand were to praise Yahweh with the instruments that I made to give praise," David said.
\v 6 He divided them into groups that corresponded to Levi's sons: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

\s5
\p
\v 7 From the clans descended from Gershon, 
\q there were Ladan and Shimei.
\q
\v 8 There were three of Ladan's sons: Jehiel the leader, Zetham, and Joel.
\q
\v 9 There were three of Shimei's sons: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran. These were the leaders of the clans of Ladan.
\q

\s5
\v 10 There were four of Shimei's sons: Jahath, Ziza, Jeush, and Beriah.
\q
\v 11 Jahath was the oldest, and Ziza the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were considered as one clan with the same duties.
\m

\s5
\v 12 There were four of Kohath's sons:
\q Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
\q
\v 13 These were Amram's sons: Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his descendants were chosen on a permanent basis to dedicate the things that completely belong to Yahweh, to offer incense to Yahweh, to serve him, and to give blessings in his name forever.
\v 14 But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were considered to be Levites. 
\q

\s5
\v 15 Moses' sons were Gershom and Eliezer.
\q
\v 16 Gershom's descendant was Shebuel the oldest.
\q
\v 17 Eliezer's descendant was Rehabiah. Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had many descendants.
\q
\v 18 Izhar's son was Shelomith the leader.
\q

\s5
\v 19 Hebron's descendants were Jeriah, the oldest, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
\q
\v 20 Uzziel's sons were Micah the oldest, and Isshiah the second.
\q

\s5
\v 21 Merari's sons were Mahli and Mushi. Mahli's sons were Eleazar and Kish.
\q
\v 22 Eleazar died without having any sons. He had only daughters. The sons of Kish married them.
\q
\v 23 Mushi's three sons were Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth.

\s5
\p
\v 24 These were Levi's descendants corresponding to their clans. They were the leaders, counted and listed by name, of the clans that did the work in the service of Yahweh's house, from twenty years old and upward.
\v 25 For David said, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people. He makes his home in Jerusalem forever.
\v 26 The Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all the equipment used in its service."

\s5
\v 27 For by David's last words the Levites were counted, from twenty years old and upward.
\v 28 Their duty was to assist Aaron's descendants in the service of Yahweh's house. They were to care for the courtyards, the rooms, the ceremonial purification of all the things that belong to Yahweh, and other work in the service of God's house.
\v 29 They also took care of the bread of the presence, the fine flour for grain offerings, the unleavened wafers, the baked offerings, the offerings mixed with oil, and all the measuring of the amounts and sizes of things. 

\s5
\v 30 They also stood every morning to thank and praise Yahweh. They also did this in the evening
\v 31 and whenever burnt offerings were offered to Yahweh, on the Sabbath and at the new moon festivals and feast days. A fixed number, assigned by decree, always had to be present before Yahweh.

\s5
\v 32 They were in charge of the tent of meeting, the holy place, and helped their fellow descendants of Aaron in the service of Yahweh's house.

\s5
\c 24
\p
\v 1 The work groups based on Aaron's descendants were these: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
\v 2 Nadab and Abihu died before their father died. They had no children, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
\v 3 David, together with Zadok, a descendant of Eleazar, and Ahimelech, a descendant of Ithamar, divided them into groups for their work as priests.

\s5
\v 4 There were more leading men among Eleazar's descendants than among Ithamar's descendants, so they divided Eleazar's descendants into sixteen groups. They did this by heads of clans and by Ithamar's descendants. These divisions were eight in number, corresponding to their clans.
\v 5 They divided them impartially by lot, for there were holy officials and officials of God, from both Eleazar's descendants and Ithamar's descendants.

\s5
\v 6 Shemaiah son of Nethanel the scribe, a Levite, wrote down their names in the presence of the king, the officials, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the leaders of the priestly and Levite families. One clan was drawn by lot from Eleazar's descendants, and then the next would be drawn from Ithamar's descendants.

\s5
\p
\v 7 The first lot went to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
\v 8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
\v 9 the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
\v 10 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,

\s5
\v 11 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
\v 12 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
\v 13 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
\v 14 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,

\s5
\v 15 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
\v 16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,
\v 17 the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
\v 18 the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.

\s5
\v 19 This was the order of their service, when they came into Yahweh's house, following the procedure given to them by Aaron their ancestor, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had instructed him.

\s5
\p
\v 20 These were the rest of the Levi:
\q of the sons of Amram, Shebuel. 
\q of the sons of Shebael, Jehdeiah.
\q
\v 21 The sons of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the leader.
\q
\v 22 Of the Izarites, Shelomoth; the sons of She Lomoth, Jahath.
\q

\s5
\v 23 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the leader, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the
fourth.
\q
\v 24 The sons of Uzziel's descendants included Micah. Micah's descendants included Shamir.
\q
\v 25 Micah's brother was Isshiah. Isshiah's sons included Zechariah.
\q

\s5
\v 26 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah, Beno.
\q
\v 27 The sons of Merari: Jaaziah, Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
\q
\v 28 The sons of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.
\q

\s5
\v 29 The sons of Kish, the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel
\q
\v 30 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. 
\m
These were the Levites, listed by their families.
\v 31 These men who were the head of each father's house and each of their younger brothers, cast lots in the presence of King David, and Zadok and Ahimelech, along with the leaders of the families of the priests and Levites. They threw lots just as Aaron's descendants had done. 

\s5
\c 25
\p
\v 1 David and the leaders of the tabernacle work selected for the work some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun. These men prophesied with harps, stringed instruments, and cymbals. Here is a list of the men who did this work:
\v 2 From the sons of Asaph: 
\q Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph, under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied under the king's supervision.
\m
\v 3 From the sons of Jeduthun:
\q Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six in all, under the direction of their father Jeduthun, who played the harp for giving thanks and praising Yahweh.
\m

\s5
\v 4 From the sons of Heman: 
\q Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth.
\v 5 All these were the sons of Heman the king's prophet. God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters in order to honor him.

\s5
\v 6 All these were under the direction of their fathers. They were musicians in Yahweh's house, with cymbals and stringed instruments as they served in God's house. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the king's supervision.
\v 7 They and their brothers who were skilled and trained to make music to Yahweh numbered 288.
\v 8 They threw lots for their duties, all alike, the young as well as the old, the teacher as the student.

\s5
\p
\v 9 Now regarding Asaph's sons: 
\q the first lot fell to Joseph's family;
\q the second fell to Gedaliah's family, twelve persons in number;

\s5
\c 26
\p
\v 1 Here were the divisions of the gatekeepers: 
\q From the Korahites, Meshelemiah son of Kore, a descendant of Asaph.
\q
\v 2 Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,
\v 3 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh.
\q

\s5

\v 5 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peullethai the eighth, for God had blessed Obed Edom.
\v 6 To Shemaiah his son were born sons who ruled over their families; they were men with many abilities.
\q

\s5
\v 7 The sons of Shemaiah were Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad. His relatives Elihu and Semachiah were also men with many abilities.
\v 8 All these were descendants of Obed Edom. They and their sons and relatives were men capable of doing their duties in the tabernacle service. There were sixty-two of them related to Obed Edom.
\v 9 Meshelemiah had sons and relatives, capable men, eighteen in all.
\q

\s5
\v 10 Hosah, a descendant of Merari, had sons: Shimri the leader (although he was not the firstborn, his father made him leader),
\v 11 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth. All of Hosah's sons and kinsmen were thirteen in number.

\s5
\p
\v 12 These divisions of the gatekeepers, corresponding to their leaders, had responsibilities, like their relatives, to serve in Yahweh's house.
\v 13 They threw lots, both young and old, corresponding to their families, for every gate.
\v 14 When the lot was thrown for the east gate, it fell to Shelemiah. They then threw lots for Zechariah his son, a prudent advisor, and his lot came out for the north gate.

\s5
\v 15 To Obed Edom was assigned the south gate, and his sons were assigned the storehouses.
\v 16 Shuppim and Hosah were assigned the west gate along with the gate of Shallecheth, on the upper road. Watches were established for each family.

\v 25 His relatives from the clan of Eliezer were his son Rehabiah,
\q Rehabiah's son Jeshaiah, 
\q Jeshaiah's son Joram, 
\q Joram's son Zichri, and 
\q Zichri's son Shelomoth.

\s5
\v 26 Shelomoth and his relatives were over all the storehouses holding the things that belong to Yahweh, that David the king, the family leaders, commanders over thousands and hundreds, and the army commanders had dedicated to Yahweh.
\v 27 They dedicated some of the plunder won in battles for repairing Yahweh's house.
\v 28 They were also in charge of everything that was dedicated to Yahweh by Samuel the prophet, Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner, and Joab son of Zeruiah. Everything that was dedicated to Yahweh was under the guard of Shelomoth and his relatives.

\s5
\p
\v 29 Of Izhar's descendants, Kenaniah and his sons were in charge of the civil affairs of Israel. They were officers and judges.
\v 30 Of Hebron's descendants, Hashabiah and his brothers, 1,700 capable men, were in charge of Yahweh's work and the king's work. They were on the west side of the Jordan.

\s5
\v 31 From Hebron's descendants, Jerijah was the leader of his descendants, counted from the lists of their families. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they examined the records and found among them men of ability in Jazer of Gilead.
\v 32 Jerijah had 2,700 relatives, who were capable family leaders. David made them overseers over the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and for the king's affairs.

\s5
\c 27
\p

\s5
\v 23 David did not count those twenty years old or younger, because Yahweh had promised to increase Israel like the stars of heaven.
\v 24 Joab son of Zeruiah began to count the men, but did not finish. Wrath fell on Israel for this. This number was not written down in the Chronicles of King David.

\s5
\p
\v 25 Azmaveth son of Adiel was in charge of the king's treasuries. Jonathan son of Uzziah was over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the fortified towers.

\v 34 Ahithophel's position was taken by Jehoiada son of Benaiah, and by Abiathar. Joab was commander of the king's army.

\s5
\c 28
\p
\v 1 David assembled all the officials of Israel at Jerusalem: the officials of the tribes, the officers of the divisions that served the king in their scheduled work, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, the managers over all the property and possessions of the king and of his sons, and the officers and fighting men, including the most skilled of them.

\s5
\v 2 Then David the king rose to his feet and said, "Listen to me, my brothers and my people. It was my intention to build a temple for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh; a footstool for our God, and I have made preparations to build it.
\v 3 But God said to me, 'You will not build a temple for my name, because you are a man of war and have shed blood.'

\s5
\v 4 Yet Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me from all my father's family to be king over Israel forever. He has chosen the tribe of Judah as leader. In the tribe of Judah, and in my father's household, out of all my father's sons, he chose me to be king over all Israel.
\v 5 From the many sons whom Yahweh has given me, he chose Solomon, my son, to sit on the throne of the kingdom of Yahweh, over Israel.

\s5
\v 6 He said to me, 'Solomon your son will build my house and my courtyards, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
\v 7 I will establish his kingdom forever, if he remains committed to obey my commandments and decrees, as you are this day.'

\s5
\v 8 Now then, in the sight of all Israel, this assembly for Yahweh, and in the presence of our God, all of you must keep and try to carry out
all the commandments of Yahweh your God. Do this so that you may possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance to your children after you forever.

\s5
\p
\v 9 As for you, Solomon my son, obey the God of your father, and serve him with your whole heart and a willing spirit. Do this because Yahweh searches all hearts and understands every motivation of everyone's thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you abandon him, he will reject you permanently.
\v 10 Realize that Yahweh has chosen you to build this temple as his sanctuary. Be strong and do it."

\s5
\p
\v 11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the plans for the temple portico, the temple buildings, the storerooms, the upper rooms, the inner rooms, and the room with the atonement lid.
\v 12 He gave him the plans he had drawn for the courtyards of Yahweh's house, all the surrounding rooms, the storerooms in God's house, and the treasuries for the things that belong to Yahweh.

\s5
\v 13 He gave him regulations for the divisions of the priests and Levites, for the assigned responsibilities for the service of the house of Yahweh, and for all the objects for the service in Yahweh's house.
\v 14 He gave him the weight of all the gold vessels for every kind of service and of all the silver vessels, for all the objects for every kind of service.
\v 15 These details were given by weight, including the details for the gold lampstands and gold lamps, the details by weight for every lampstand, for the lamps, for the silver lampstands, and details for the proper use of every lampstand.

\s5
\v 16 He gave the weight of the gold for the tables of the bread of the presence, for every table, and the weight of the silver for the silver tables.
\v 17 He gave the weight of pure gold for the meat forks, basins, and cups. He gave the weight for each of the gold bowls, and the weight of each of the silver bowls.

\s5
\v 18 He gave the weight of refined gold for the incense altar, and of the gold for the design of the cherubim that spread out their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.
\v 19 David said, "I have put all this in writing as Yahweh directed me and gave me to understand regarding the design."

\s5
\p
\v 20 David said to Solomon his son, "Be strong and brave. Do the work. Do not be afraid or anxious, for Yahweh God, my God, is with you. He will not leave you nor abandon you until all the work for the service of Yahweh's temple is finished.
\v 21 See, here are the divisions of the priests and Levites for all the service in God's temple. They will be with you, together with all willing and skillful men, to assist you in the work and to perform the service. The officials and all the people are ready to follow your commands."

\s5
\c 29
\p
\v 1 King David said to the whole assembly, "Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is still young and inexperienced, and the task is great. For the temple is not for people but for Yahweh God.
\v 2 So I have done my best to provide for the temple of my God. I am giving gold for the things to be made of gold, silver for the things to be made of silver, bronze for the things to be made of bronze, iron for the things to be made of iron, and wood for the things to be made of wood. I am also giving onyx stones, stones to be set, stones for inlaid work of various colors—all kinds of precious stones—and marble stone in abundance.

\s5
\v 3 Now, because of my delight in the house of my God, I am giving my personal treasure of gold and silver for it. I am doing this in addition to all that I have prepared for this holy temple: 
\v 4 three thousand talents of gold from Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, in order to overlay the walls of the buildings.
\v 5 I am donating gold for the things to be made of gold, and silver for the things to be made of silver, and things for all kinds of work to be done by craftsmen. Who else wants to make a contribution to Yahweh today and give himself to him?"

\s5
\p
\v 6 Then freewill offerings were made by the leaders of their ancestors' families, the leaders of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and by the officials over the king's work.
\v 7 They gave for the service of God's house five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of silver, and 100,000 talents of iron.

\s5
\v 8 Those who had precious stones gave them to the treasury of Yahweh's house, under the supervision of Jehiel, a descendant of Gershon.
\v 9 The people rejoiced because of these freewilll offerings, because they had contributed wholeheartedly to Yahweh. King David also rejoiced greatly.

\s5
\p
\v 10 David blessed Yahweh in front of all the assembly. He said, "May you be praised, Yahweh, God of Israel our ancestor, forever and ever.
\v 11 Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty. For all that is in the heavens and on the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, Yahweh, and you are exalted as ruler over all.

\s5
\v 12 Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all people. In your hand is power and might. You possess the strength and might to make people great and to give strength to anyone.
\v 13 Now then, our God, we thank you and praise your glorious name.

\s5
\v 14 But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly these things? Indeed, all things come from you, and we have simply given back to you what is yours.
\v 15 For we are strangers and travelers before you, as all our ancestors were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope of remaining on earth.

\s5
\v 16 Yahweh our God, all this wealth that we have collected in order to build a temple to honor your holy name—it comes from you and belongs to you.
\v 17 I know also, my God, that you examine the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things, and now I look with joy as your people who are present here willingly offer gifts to you.

\s5
\v 18 Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel—our ancestors—keep this forever in the thoughts of the minds of your people. Direct their hearts toward you.
\v 19 Give to Solomon my son a wholehearted desire to keep your commandments, your covenant decrees, and your statutes, and to carry out all these plans to build the palace for which I have made provision."

\s5
\p
\v 20 David said to all the assembly, "Now bless Yahweh your God." All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, bowed their heads and worshiped Yahweh and prostrated themselves before the king.
\v 21 On the next day, they made sacrifices to Yahweh and offered burnt offerings to him. They offered a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.

\s5
\v 22 On that day, they ate and drank before Yahweh with great celebration.
\p They made Solomon, David's son, king a second time, and anointed him with Yahweh's authority to be ruler. They also anointed Zadok to be priest.
\v 23 Then Solomon sat on Yahweh's throne as king instead of David his father. He prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.

\s5
\v 24 All the leaders, soldiers, and King David's sons gave allegiance to King Solomon.
\v 25 Yahweh greatly honored Solomon before all Israel and bestowed on him greater power than he had ever given to any king before him in Israel.

\s5
\p
\v 26 David son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
\v 27 David had been king of Israel for forty years. He ruled for seven years in Hebron and for thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
\v 28 He died at a good old age, after enjoying a long life, wealth and honor. Solomon his son succeeded him.

\s5
\v 29 King David's accomplishments are written in the history of Samuel the prophet, in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the prophet.
\v 30 Recorded there are the deeds of his rule, his accomplishments and the events that affected him, Israel, and all the kingdoms of the other lands.
